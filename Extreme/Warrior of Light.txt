	raidwide

mini-phase 2
	imbued saber (fire/ice)
	specter of light (summoner + warrior) + solemn confiteor - summons a summoner that creates the four dragons, and a warrior that casts perfect decimation
		split into pairs, either all supports or all dps will get markers for perfect decimation cones
		if you have a marker, you DO NOT take the tether, otherwise take the tether
		marked players go to cardinals to bait cones, tethered players go to intercardinals to point tethers away
		dodge the solemn confiteor puddles
