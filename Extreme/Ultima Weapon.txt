viscous aetheroplasm - a stacking debuff on the MT that kills if it reaches 5 stacks, swap on 4

mistral song - garuda appears in the centre of the arena and does a big cleave in front of her
vulcan burst - a knockback from the boss, don't get knocked into the cleave

ceruleum vent - a minor uncast point-blank aoe, don't bother dodging

eye of the storm - a doughnut aoe around the edges of the room
geocrush - proximity damage from the centre of the room, wait for the doughnut to go off, then move to the edge

ceruleum vent
viscous aetheroplasm

loops from mistral song + vulcan burst until ~80% hp

radiant plume - a set of eight aoes around the edge of the room, go to the middle to avoid them
weight of the land - a set of four aoes in the middle of the room, go to the edge to avoid them

viscous aetheroplasm

tank purge - a big raidwide

radiant plume + weight of the land 2 - this time you start in the middle, then go to the edge

ceruleum vent
viscous aetheroplasm

loops from first radiant plume + weight of the land until <65% hp

eruption - spawns five puddles under two random players that explode after a short delay
	party should stack up and try to run as a group away from the puddles

ceruleum vent
viscous aetheroplasm
raidwide

radiant plume + crimson cyclone x2 -spawns two sets of aoes, with ifrit also spawning at the edge of the arena
	the first set of aoes are four equally space around the edge, the second set is a line through the middle
	ifrit will dash through the arena from his spawn location, so don't be in line with that

ceruleum vent
viscous aetheroplasm

loops from eruption until <50% hp

final phase loop - executes these mechanics on rotation, with five mini-mechanics based on hp percentage
	viscous aetheroplasm
	ceruleum vent
	viscous aetheroplasm

	aetheroplasm orb - two random players get a marker, and a green orb travels from the boss towards each of them until it is soaked or it times out

	magitek ray - turn towards a random player and fires three line aoes on the ground one after another
		will always be fired NW, N and NE relative to ultima's facing direction

	raidwide
	viscous aetheroplasm
	ceruleum vent
	viscous aetheroplasm
	magitek ray

	loops until enrage


aetheric boom - cast at 50%, a big knockback that also spawns tethered orbs that move towards each other
	orbs are tethered in pairs and need to be soaked by a stack, soaking one orb in a pair also soaks the other one
	if a pair of orbs touches each other, it's a wipe
	this first set spawns one orb at each of the cardinals, with opposite-cardinal orbs being tethered

magitek bits - at 40%, spawns in six magitek bits that cast assault cannon, just kill them
	assault cannon - a dodgeable line aoe
freefire - calls down two airships in the east and west that deal proximity based damage

aetheric boom 2 - cast at 30%, two longer tethers from east to west and a shorter tether from north to south
	prioritise the short one first

magitek bits 2 - at ~25%, summons eight magitek bits around the outside of the arena this time
freefire 2 - summons four ships, each on one of the cardinals, go into the middle to dodge

aetheric boom 3 - cast at 15%, four short pairs towards each of the intercardinals
	it's usually best to tank LB3 and have people run into the orbs quickly, time is tight here
