the seeing left/right/wings

prelude to liberation - a long cast point-blank aoe, followed by line dodges and big aoes on random players
	the lines leave fire puddles, so be careful

the seeing left/right/wings

bloody fuller - a big transition raidwide, gives vulns if ganas are not killed in time
	also destroys some of the outer railings, beware

pillars of heaven - a knockback from the centre, don't get knocked off
laughing rose - a strange-looking white marker that's just a stack, everyone quickly back to centre after the knockback

surpanakha - a prey marker on a random player that should be passed to the MT
	the marked player will have several big cleaves fires towards them, so stay away
	continues firing after the rose of conviction and hate

rose of conviction - spawns five tethered orbs that tether to random players, kite them away from others by moving around the edge of the arena
rose of hate - a line aoe on the main tank

swift liberation - marks four random players with swords from 1 to 4 then dashes to them in sequence
	have 1 go north, 2 go east etc while the raid stays in mid behind ravana
	AS SOON as you see the dash, move towards mid as it gives a vuln which kills you if you get hit twice
	this is followed by a cross aoe to dodge along with more big aoes on each player, can assign quadrants if needed
	the cross aoe leaves fire behind, be careful

final liberation - marks two players with preys for dashes and, after the first dashes, three players get big aoes and he will dash again
	have the preys go north and south while party stacks east
	big aoes spread out around east while two non-aoes pick up the preys
	new preys move between north/south and west as the dashes come from where the first preys got hit, not mid
	everyone else goes mid, while aoes and preys join then as soon as they can
	dodge the doughnut in mid, then quickly get out to dodge the point-blank aoe and knockback
