thunder ii - a big frontal cleave, dodge to the side

daughter (knockback) - spawns the daughter head at a random corner that does a massive knockback, use kb resist or position to go to the opposite corner

arms of wisdom - a tankbuster with a knockback and swap, don't stand at the edge

aion teleos - spawns clones around the arena that tether to sophia and gain her abilities
	will either be a thunder ii pattern (with a clone N/S) or a thunder iii pattern (clones all in corners)

thunder ii/iii - thunder iii is a doughnut

aero iii - a point-blank aoe that knocks back as well

execute - causes all clones to use the ability that they gained while tethered to sophia
	stand behind a thunder ii clone or underneath a thunder iii clone

tankbuster

cloudy heavens - add phase, spawns the first, second and third demiurges and zombifies players that die during it
	the first demiurge - should be killed last and tanked by the MT
		horizontal/vertical kenoma - gains directional parry on the sides or front/back respectively, stop attacking on vertical
		infusion - a targetted line aoe on a random player, everyone else needs to stack directly in the middle with the tank first in line
	the second demiurge - should be killed first and has no aggro table
		divine spark - a gaze attack, look away
	the third demiurge - should be killed second and tanked by the OT towards the corner
		gnostic spear - a line aoe on a random player
		ring of pain - a point-blank aoe that spawns an ice puddle underneath it, make sure this is placed in the corner
		gnostic rant - a 270-degree cleave in front of the add, stay behind it

scales of revelation - tips the arena from side to side, always start NE
the scales of wisdom - big transition raidwide

quasar (proximity) - spawns three orange meteors on one scale and one blue meteor on the opposite (this informs players that 3 orange = 1 blue) and baits proximity aoes under random players
	staying in NE, bait puddles then run SW
	no knockback as the meteors cancel out

aero/thunder iii

quasar (always short tilt) - from now on, the meteors will not balance each other out and players need to go to the correct side
	always dodge AWAY from the blue meteors
	to see if it's a long or short tilt, look at the parity of the tethers: even = long tilt, odd = short tilt
	for long tilt go all the way to the edge, for short tilt stay ~75% towards the edge

cintamani - a multi-hit raidwide

{immediately skips to here when below 75% hp}
thunder ii
quasar (always long tilt) + sophia rush - dodge the dash attack on the safe half of the arena
