abyssal nox - reduces every player's hp to 1 and gives them a doom that is removed by healing to full hp
abyssal echoes - sends lines towards random cardinals and intercardinals that do big point-blank aoes at the tips
	the patterns mean this is only ever north > nw dodge or nw > north dodge

sable thread - a multi-hit line stack that deals higher damage to the first two targets hit, so have tanks in front

dark matter - three-hit tankbuster on both tanks

visceral whirl - tentacles cleave across the arena indicated by lines, go to the safe triangle
miasmic blast - leaves three crosses on the arena that do big line aoes diagonally, find the safe spot and run there

flare - creates two stack towers, one NW and one SE
	melees (+potential fake melee) go into NW tower, ranged into SE tower
	run out as soon as you take damage, then dodge the lines coming from the towers
		will either be mid, east/west or NE/SW

void bio - summons a row of poison orbs that float one by one through the arena, getting hit leaves an almost-unhealable dot
visceral whirl + miasmic blast

big bang - makes loads of puddles on the floor and marks everyone with a spread aoe
	at the end of the cast, everyone gets several debuffs for later, including a dot and max hp reduction
	debuffs are explained when they resolve in the fight

void meteor - summons an array of meteors in the north half of the arena, plus a couple in the south half
meteor impact - all supports, then all dps (or vice versa) get targetted for proximity tethers, then meteors fly towards each of them
	meteors need to be placed away from other meteors or it's a wipe (red aoe marker)
	if you're too close or stand in someone else's tether, you get one shot
	players are bound shortly before meteors hit them, just in case
	assign meteor positions from left to right with melees towards the left and ranged towards the right
	these pairs will be used later too
	finally, the meteors explode in point-blank aoes

big bang (chains + acceleration bomb) + visceral whirl + miasmic blast - supports and dps are chained together
	stack mid at the start, then dps go to the north safe spot while supports go to the south safe spot
	stay still for acceleration bomb, then move to the miasmic blast safe spot

big bang (spread) - immediately spread out from the safe spot to avoid overlapping

big bang (forked lightning + stack) + tankbusters - dps with forked lightning DO NOT stack

black hole - marks a player to place the black hole
fractured eventide - faces a direction where the giant laser beam will start from before moving across the arena
	black hole player places the hole in the northern corner zeromus is facing towards, then IMMEDIATELY MOVES WHEN THE MARKER DISAPPEARS
	getting hit by the black hole is a one shot
	everyone runs tightly behind the laser beam to dodge

big crunch - functionally the same as big bang, but only gives the dot, and removes the max hp penalty
	abyssal nox is next, so don't heal too much

abyssal nox + abyssal echoes
sable thread

sparking/branding flare - creates two stack towers in mid, have the red and purple pairs take the western tower and the yellow and blue pairs take the eastern tower
	the lines will always make the cardinals unsafe, so players run to assigned corners immediately
	if sparking - spread aoes target every player
	if branding - pair stacks target all dps or all supports
nox - marks two players for big following aoes, they need to stand directly in the corner and move across one edge of the arena
	use your eyes and don't move into someone else's following aoe

void bio + visceral whirl + miasmic blast
tankbusters
branding/sparking flare + nox - opposite of the first one

loops from abyssal nox + abyssal echoes until 25% hp

rend the rift - big multi-hit raidwide that transitions to phase 2

dimensional surge x4 - four sets of baited puddles under each player

nostalgia - another big multi-hit raidwide

flow of the abyss - causes a line aoe to hit either north, south or mid, look west to see where it's coming from
	then one of three effects will happen
		umbral rays - everyone stacks up
		umbral prism - two-player enumerations, use the same meteor/flare pairs in the rough same order as meteors
		akh rhai - spread out, then move into a safe space since the spreads hit multiple times

chasmic nails + dimensional surge - look west for the line aoe, then watch the five cones on the ground to see which order they hit in
	dodge from a later one into an earlier one
	there are also semi-baited puddles, so careful not to screw yourself out of space

dimensional surge x2
flow of the abyss
chasmic nails + dimensional surge

loops from dimensional surge x4 until enrage
