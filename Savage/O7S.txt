magitek ray - fires a dodgeable beam towards a random player

arm and hammer - tankbuster

atomic ray - raidwide and marks all dps for orb drops
	dps should spread away from the boss as the orbs explode afterwards

missile - marks one player with a prey and gives them a nasty dot

load - begins loading the program on the big screen and casts an ability
	there are two different timelines that it can do
	each timeline is a series of connected mini-phases

bibliotaph
	load (bibliotaph) + demon simulation - spawns four summoning circles that require four players in each
		have the melees take the north and east circles while the ranged take south and west
		need to lock them before demon simulation is cast

dadaluma
	load (dadaluma) - does a big knockback from the boss, either stand close or use knockback resist

	missile simulation + chakra burst - dodge the missiles while standing in the yellow towers
		assign clock spots for players and take the tower on your spot
		melees can be intercardinal, ranged cardinal?
	
	run program (dadaluma) - spawns dadaluma, should be tanked close to the boss
	
	magitek ray + wave cannon - dodge the ray and whoever gets the blue marker goes to the side of dadaluma away from the boss
	tankbuster + wave cannon
	missile
	magitek ray

ultros
	load (ultros) - does big spread aoes on each player, go to rough clocks
	
	diffractive plasma - raidwide

	tentacle simulation - spawns tentacle aoes under every player that will do line aoes in the direction they were facing after a delay
		stack up behind the boss and face towards it, then move to the side

	run program (ultros) - spawns ultros, drag the boss over to ultros
	stoneskin - interrupt ultros

	air raid - the boss flies up, becoming untargetable and fires at a random player
		this can be baited into the corner
	main cannon - after a few shots, there will be a proximity aoe on the bait spot so make sure you've run to the opposite corner in time

	raidwide

air force
	load (air force) - does a point-blank aoe that stuns
		the snapshotting is INCREDIBLY unfair here, get out quickly

	missile simulation + run program (air force) - dodge missiles while dps get tethered by air force adds
		need to go towards your add and point it away from the party to bait the big cone aoe

	bomb deployment - two bombs spawn with a red and blue loop
		one loop lights up and you stand in that loop to defuse
		gives a fire resist down so two people need to defuse the bombs

	tankbuster
	magitek ray


timeline 1
	load (bibliotaph)

	skip program (dadaluma) - skips over the current program and loads the next program instead

	retrieve program (ultros) - retrieves the previously skipped program and loads it
	copy program (ultros) - copies the current program for much later

	load (air force)

timeline 2
	load (dadaluma)

	skip program (bibliotaph)

	retrieve program (air force)
	copy program (air force)

	load (ultros)


skip program (virus) - tethers each dps to a support and gives them magnet debuffs plus another debuff
	these debuffs can be baited by staying far away/close respectively
	searing wind - a massive aoe blast that is given to players with LIKE charges
		if you get this, go to the edges of the arena right into the corners
		support tether can go west, dps tether can go east
	abandonment - need to be stacking with at least one other player at the end of the debuff
		if you get this stay close to the boss which should be in mid
		dps slightly behind the boss, supports slightly in front
		make sure to stay tightly stacked with the player of the same role, they are who you stay with for abandonment
	aether rot - afflicts one player who has abandonment
		will pass to another player if they move into you
		cannot take it again after it has been taken from you
		keep passing this around
		five? passes are needed

raidwide x2
missile

viral weapon - removes the rot debuff and applies misdirection to everyone

magitek ray
air raid + main cannon

diffractive radar - stop moving, but can remain attacking or casting

tankbuster
raidwide

enhanced ultros
	load (ultros)

	load (air force)
