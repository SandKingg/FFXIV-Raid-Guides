dragon dance (flip + spin) - two sets of either a flip or spin, will be notated when the SECOND step goes off
	spin + spin - a point-blank aoe
	spin + flip - a doughnut aoe
	flip + spin - a massive cross-shaped aoe from the boss
	flip + flip - a massive plus-shaped aoe from the boss

akh morn - a multi-hit stack on a random player

dragon dance (spin + spin)

tail end - tankbuster, swap on this first one so nobody runs out of cds later

earth shaker - cone aoes on every player, assign clock spots

dragon dance (spin)
tankbuster
dragon dance (flip) + thunderstorm - lightning aoes on all dps or all supports, try to stay in colour pairs

time immemorial - small raidwide and gives debuffs to the tanks that inflict doom if they take damage from the wrong type, swap if necessary
	blue - flying gives doom
	beige - walking gives doom

tankbuster

northern cross - makes the ground icy, causing players to slide if they move

dragon dance (spin)

akh rhai + ice storm - gives icy aoes to the healers and targets two random dps with repeated aoes
	healers place ice at the edge to stop the expanding aoes taking up too much room

dragon dance (spin) + horrid roar - stay max melee to bait the puddles and give enough time to dodge in or out

add phase - spawns a dragon tethered to several immortal keys
	the flying tank should tank the add
	party focus down one key at a time starting with the ones at the ends of tethers
	rime wreath - raidwide
	kill dragon last
	dark wave - a point-blank aoe on death
	one tank picks up the ancient bulwark at the end
protostar - big multi-hit transition raidwide

cauterize + thunderstorm + horrid roar x2 - look where he spawns to dodge the dashes, don't go near the bulwark tank

time immemorial - be careful, he's walking now

crimson breath x4 - marks non-tanks with a red marker, then does a one-shot cleave towards them
	if a player has the bulwark, they take no damage but it loses power
	have a dedicated 'bulwark spot' on the side of the boss for players to run to, and everyone else stack up away from there
	(if you want consistency, the tank who didn't take bulwark at the start can take it now)

crimson orbs - spawns three sets of orbs in the centre, then at two opposite corners while also spawning a tether from the boss to a random player
	the orbs will explode in sequence, doing line aoes bomberman-style
horrid roar - party stacks on the third set of orbs to appear, directly in the corner, tether player makes sure they have the bulwark and goes to a corner with no orbs
	once the puddles appear party dodges the puddles
	wait for the centre orbs to explode then party runs into the centre, behind the boss and towards the second set of orbs
	tether player moves into the centre, still pointing the boss towards the non-bomb corner and stays there
hot tail - after the third set of bombs explodes, the boss casts a big line aoe towards the tethered player, they need the bulwark to survive

cauterize + exaflares + horrid roar - dodge the dash and stay behind the moving exaflares ASAP

cauterize + horrid roar - exaflares are still moving at this point, be careful
boss is FLYING again now, make sure to swap as there is one auto before the buster
