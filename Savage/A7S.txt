corporal punishment - spawns two sets of two magic hammer puddles under players that remove mp and apply a bleed, dodge them

sizzlebeam - marks a player with a purple marker, then fires a beam towards them, giving a nasty dot to anyone hit, move to the side

sizzlespark - raidwide that gives a small lightning vuln up, don't be on spikes for this

bombs (8) - drops a bomb on every player that follows behind them, getting hit gives a magic vuln
	assign spots, with ranged in the outside corners and melee at the cardinals in mid
	ranged should run into their corner to drag the bomb as far as possible

bombs (1) - drops a bomb on a single player, they should take it away from the group
	also indicates the jails you get:
		healer bomb - healer/tank jails
		dps bomb - dps jails

jails - spawns two jails based on the bomb that require different roles to do different tasks
	tank (white) - mitigate the tankbusters, don't get knocked into the wall and kill the add
	healer (green) - stand on the small hole leaking poision to stop it, while briefly stepping off to heal yourself
	dps (purple) - kill the add before you die to the debuff
	caster (red) - raid needs to kill the padlock to stop the pyretic debuff, then kill the add with a big physical vuln down
zoomdoom - the boss lifts up from the air, giving hp down to players near him
	one player is marked for a prey and one player is marked for a tether, these will get players to enter jails
	prey should be passed to the correct role in the middle, everyone else stay away from middle
	tether should be passed close to the jail corner in mid
	the boss stuns and grabs the prey player, so do not be near them
adds - adds spawn during the jail phase
	panzer doll - should be tanked and killed before they explode after 30 seconds
	sturm doll - should be tanked and kugelblitz needs to be stunned

		if it reaches the boss, he gains 4 damage up stacks which is basically a wipe
