punishing heat - a heavy-hitting tankbuster, with a divine ray cleave before and after it
	good to pre-pop some mitigation for this so it's up later

blazing scourge - marks two players for preys that hit multiple times, dealing a lot of damage

incinerating heat - a stack on a random player

mega holy x2 - raidwide

gravitational anomaly - places small black puddles on the arena that will expand into bigger aoes
	make sure to stay well away from them

sacrament/radiant sacrament - one of two abilities
	sacrament - fires four big line aoes towards the cardinals in the direction the boss is facing
	radiant sacrament - a doughnut aoe, run into the boss's hitbox

tankbuster combo - from now on a combo means there are divine spears, otherwise it's just the tankbuster by itself

add phase - three waves of adds
	wave 1 - 8 arrhidaeus's lanners
		these just auto-attack, group them up and aoe down
	wave 2 - 4 general's wings
		these cast almost holy, a big raidwide
		each cast gives them a stacking buff that increases more and more each time
		start north and kill them going clockwise
		use mitigation for the last one or two
	wave 3 - the general's time + the general's might
		the general's time - casts half gravity, a tankbuster
			make sure to tank them apart so the giant aoe doesn't overlap
			gains increasing magical damage up stacks
		the general's might - auto-attacks and does uncast physical tankbusters
			gains increasing physical damage up stacks
divine judgment - a massive transition raidwide, use tank LB3 at 4-5 seconds remaining to survive

chronofoil - gives the boss wings

temporal stasis - gives players debuffs then stops time at the end of the cast and executes them
	three random dps get defamation, a massive point-blank aoe
	the tanks are tethered with either blue (restraining order) or red/green (house arrest)
		blue tether needs to be stretched as far as possible, red/green tether is a stack essentially
	one healer and the remaining dps get shared sentence
		this is a pair stack
	tanks
		one tank flexes, the other stays static
		static tank always goes north to A, while flex tank adjusts for the tether
	dps
		assign one dps each to east, south and west while the final dps adjusts
		if a dps gets defamation, they go to their spot
			if flex dps gets it, they go to whichever spot isn't taken
		shared sentence dps goes north and stacks with one or both tanks on A
	healers
		healers will stack north, a bit away from the tank/dps stack, on B

gravitational anomaly + sacrament/radiant sacrament - depending on positioning you may need to rotate to dodge the aoes and sprint can be useful here
raidwide
tankbuster combo

temporal stasis 2 - different debuffs this time
	one tank and one healer get defamation
	the other tank and healer get a tether
	two dps get shared sentence
	the other two dps get another tether
	tanks
		tether tank always flexes here either to south or on B
		defamation tank goes east
	healers
		tether healer always goes north on B
		defamation healer goes west
	dps
		tether dps go north on A, unless one needs to flex south for the tether
		shared sentence dps go north, away from each other and stack with the two tethers, one on A and one on B

gravitational anomaly + sacrament/radiant sacrament - always opposite of the previous sacrament
raidwide
tankbuster combo

timegate - sends adds into four portals on the intercardinals
	one dps each goes into the NE and NW portals and destroys the general's wing
	OT goes into the SW portal and destroys the general's might, watch out for the tankbusters
	one healer goes into the SE portal and destroys the general's time, heal through the damage
	if the adds are not killed in 60 seconds, it's a wipe

judgment crystal - marks a random player that didn't go into the timegate and drops a crystal on their position
	we want these crystals in specific places to help with inception later
	starting north, place them two 'teeth' clockwise of the cardinals
	MT should be moving the boss to help with positioning here
	if the boss moves next to a crystal, it explodes with proximity-based damage

inception - the boss disappears and turns invisible, then reappears on a random cardinal or intercardinal
	the nearest crystal will begin displaying a proximity marker, indicating where alexander is near
sacrament - this is cast instantly when alexander reappears
	you need to dodge 135 degrees away from the crystal to avoid getting blasted by the sacrament beam
radiant sacrament - run in as fast as possible

tankbuster combo
gravitational anomaly + incinerating heat - always stack mid here

inception 2 - this time players get debuffs as well
	one tank gets defamation
	one healer gets shared sentence
	every other player is tethered
	defamation tank always goes left, looking at the crystal
	shared sentence healer always goes right, looking at the crystal
	all short tethers go right, while long tethers need to adjust on the fly, going to opposite safe spots
sacrament
radiant sacrament

tankbuster combo
gravitational anomaly + incinerating heat

summon alexander - summons a massive alexander in north that empowers some abilities

void of repentance - spawns two wormhole puddles at east and west
	these need to be soaked three times each to disappear
	soaking gives a healing magic down and magic vuln up so healers should not soak unless it is an emergency
	each soak deals more damage than the last too
	the order is melee > ranged > tank with players assigned to each side

incinerating heat - only healers and melee dps can take this, everyone else has magic vuln

holy bleed - an uncast big raidwide

holy scourge + chastening heat - a massive prey marker on the MT followed by a big tankbuster
	this is always invulned, with a swap after

void of repentance 2 + communion - this time, every dps gets tethered and will drop puddles
	soaks need to be co-ordinated properly without overlapping any puddles

sacrament - the boss should be pointed away from the puddles
