elemental break - imbues with fire or lightning, then does a cone aoe on every player
	spread into clock spots for this with melees on cardinals and ranged on intercardinals
	fire - stacks on either all supports or all dps, split into pairs for this
	lightning - spread aoes on every player, have ranged move to the edge

burnt strike - imbues with fire or lightning (same element as before), then does a line aoe through the arena in the direction he's facing
	fire - a massive knockback perpendicular to the line aoe, make sure to move in towards middle after
	lightning - a larger line aoe after the original one, stay far out

bound of faith - imbues with fire or lightning (same element as before), then tethers to a random player and binds them in place
	fire - a stack on the affected player
	lightning - two large cones target the closest players which should be both tanks
		have the bound player move in front of the boss and each tank takes a side

burnished glory - raidwide + bleed

powder mark - does a tankbuster that inflicts a physical vuln and causes the tank to explode later
	make sure to swap and the previous MT stay away from the group

turn of the heavens - imbues with fire or lightning and spawns nine circles of either element, eight around the edge and one in mid
	circles of the imbued element will explode in much larger aoes, while the non-imbued element only explode exactly in their size
	drag the boss towards the non-imbued side and make sure the tank stays away from the group, but not in the imbued side

burnt strike - now all three will be the other element that wasn't done previously
bound of faith
elemental break

shifting sky - imbues with either fire or lightning then the boss disappears
	there'll be a knockback from mid where the serpent falls down then turn of the heavens circles will spawn, with a death zone under the dragon
	stacking on the non-imbued side, two players get tethered by clones that cast both versions of bound of faith
	the fire player goes clockwise and stacks with the group
	the thunder player goes anticlockwise and stacks with both tanks who need to aim their cones away from the others
	make sure to stay on the dark brown circle as the serpent will cast a doughnut aoe here
	two more clones appear, casting both versions of burnt strike, with lightning going first, then fire
	dodge the lightning then kb resist once it resolves to dodge the fire

elemental break
raidwide

elemental break (light) - now abilities can also be imbued with light
	light - a cone aoe on a tank, and both healers, split between everyone hit
		have both tanks take their cone north, while everyone else splits into lighter parties east and west

burnt strike (light) - baits puddles under each player after the line aoe goes off
	start on the boss's sides then move behind/in front to dodge the puddles

bound of faith (light) - does an aoe around the bound player that gives a mortal burn mark debuff to anyone hit
	this debuff explodes shortly after, dealing high damage
	there's a raidwide very shortly after so healers should pay attention

raidwide
tankbuster

right of the heavens - imbues with fire or lightning, then summons four laser portals, two of each element
	the portals will shoot lasers on both sides in the direction they're facing
	the imbued portals will shoot a wider laser than they indicate, while the non-imbued portals will only shoot to their width
	there are three safe spots in the safe quadrant, small squares touching ach corner of the portals
	make sure the previous MT is not stacking with the group

burnt strike
bound of faith
elemental break

sundered sky - imbues with fire or lightning, then the boss disappears, summoning laser portals again
	there will be a knockback from mid and the serpent will fall down, facing a random player
	ensure that you get knocked to the UNSAFE quadrant first, to bait the cleave later
	then move into the safe quadrant and two players get tethered for fire and light bounds of faith
	have the stack by in the safe spot closest to mid and the light be in one of the outer safe spots
	the serpent will do a 270-degree cleave and three clones will spawn, casting each version of burnt strike
	light casts first, then lightning, then fire
	if the clones are on cardinals, then stack on an intercardinal for puddles and vice versa
	the puddles are baiting as soon as the mortal burn mark explodes, so move to the edge after that and pop kb resist once the lightning aoe resolves

elemental break
raidwide

turn of the heavens 2 - imbues with fire or lightning and spawns the circles again
	this time the aoes on the outside will alternate, with mid always being lightning
elemental break - watch the imbue, circles explode before the continuation
	fire turn - spread to the edges, at the corners of the fire circles then quickly resolve elemental break continuation
	lightning turn - spread around the middle circle, then quickly resolve elemental break continuation

tankbuster

right of the heavens 2 - ensure the group stacks in the centre safe spot
bound of faith (fire/light) - if fire, stack with the group, if light, go to the spot not taken by the tank

prismatic deception - the boss disappears and the arena gets misty
	clones will spawn at each cardinal and intercardinal, with three casting blasting zone line aoes
	quickly spread to clock spots and identify which line will not be hit by the aoes and stack there, at the edge
		can use a strat where players with a clone casting a line aoe run to the centre, along with their partner
		then everyone stacks on the remaining two players
	this happens a second time, exactly the same

raidwide

cycle of faith - imbues with fire, lightning or light, then casts elemental break, burnt strike and bound of faith
	each mechanic uses the same element, so resolve them quickly one after another

raidwide
cycle of faith - a different element to the previous one
raidwide
cycle of faith - the final element
