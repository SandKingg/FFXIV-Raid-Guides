tidal roar - raidwide

rip current - a double hit tankbuster that needs a swap

tidal wave - a splash on one side of the arena, followed by a knockback from that side later
	use the markers to find the safe spots
undersea quake - breaks the two side columns of the arena

temporary current - fires a diagonal blast of water across the arena, leaving two safe spots in opposite corners

drenching pulse - baited puddles under each player followed by freak wave spread aoes on each player
	stack max melee first for puddles, then move to assigned positions
	it helps to assign positions for this for later

temporary current - opposite of previous

maelstrom - leviathan disappears and charges twice across two halves of the arena
	at the same time expanding aoes spawn that deal damage and afflict players with heavy, so avoid them

raidwide

tsunami - gives each player two debuffs that resolve in a specific order
	both healers get smothering tsunami stacks, everyone else gets a swirling waters doughnut
	one player gets a sundering tsunami line knockback (in the direction they are facing) and everyone else gets splashing waters which kills them if not hit by sundering tsunami
	stack next to his hitbox with the knockback player at max melee, knocking everyone north
undersea quake 2 - this time the middle two arena columns get broken
	assign light parties to split off into each side
temporary current - stack on healers in the safe spot

temporary current (empowered) - after the first blast, leviathan will shoot a second blast through the opposite diagonal
	quickly move into the opposite safe spot

	for this we use our light party sides with players in a specific order: tanks > melee > healers > ranged

stormy horizon - multiple small raidwides hit the group while each player drops five puddles under them
	start in the NW corner and rotate around the hitbox
breaking wave - one tank gets a flare marker and should run directly south
temporary current (empowered) - party should quickly adjust their trajectory to end up in the safe spot
	don't forget to move over, flare tank should dodge both at south
plunging wave - a multi-hit line stack on a random player
	can angle this to point south after the second temporary current to help out the tank
