seed of the sky - drops puddles on random players, dodge

mega beam - turns to a random player and charges up a laser, look where it's firing and move away

execution - spawns four square sludge puddles in the four corners and a steam regulator in each
	assign one dps per corner and have them go inside and kill the regulator
	moving outside or dying is an instant wipe
	healers make sure to heal the dps as the nisi debuff does damage

seed of the sky
mega beam

perpetual ray - a massive multi-hit tankbuster, either invuln or swap during the cast as the first hit leaves a nasty vuln

mega beam

legislation - gives each dps 1, 2, 3 or 4 stacks of final punishment, indicating how many times they need to get hit
discoid - spawns tethered orbs on all dps and one healer
	running into an orb explodes it which deals more damage the more people take the explosion
	running into your own orb instantly kills you
	orb order:
		1+4 -> healer
		2+3 -> 4
		2+4 -> 3
		3+4 -> 2
		3+4-> 1

mega beam
perpetual ray - invuln this so healers don't cry

robot phase - blaster + brawler, then swindler, then vortexer spawn in order
	have OT take blaster, while MT takes brawler
		MT is whoever PULLED onslaughter
	kill order is blaster > brawler 50 > swindler + vortexer 60 > brawler > swindler 10 > wait for enums > vortexer 10 > swindler + vortexer
	OT pulls swindler back east after killing blaster, then pulls vortexer east too
	MT provokes vortexer after brawler is killed and pulls him south
	
	blaster
		mind blast - interrupt
		blaster mirage - spawns at 50% hp and needs to be taken by brawler tank otherwise they tether and become immune
			will despawn once blaster is killed
	
	brawler
		weapon change - equips one of four different weapons and does an attack based on the weapon equipped
			single buster - a big tankbuster
			double buster - a line stack on the MT
			single drill - a proximity-based attack on a random player, move away
			double drill - two big explosions on the closest and furthest players, assign specific people to bait
				brawler's tank and a ranged player bait
				far bait will always be done in a corner
		auxiliary power - a big aoe buff that gives regen to any robot inside it
		orb phase - triggers once brawler is at 50% hp
			power plasma gamma - need to be soaked by brawler's tank
			power plasma beta - choose one to stun/slow so they stagger their hits as they are big raidwides
	
	swindler
		height - the platforms are either raised or lowered and each player has high or low vuln
			make sure you stand on the platform type that does not give you vuln
			an easy trick to remember is red debuff = red platform (red is stand on higher platforms which glow red slightly)
		bio-arithmeticks - big raidwide at 50% hp
		enumeration - will either require 2, 3 or 4 players to stand in the big circle, indicated by the number of orbs
			this is always one ONE of the tanks, split into light parties and assign a priority order
			e.g. T+M > R > H

	vortexer
		super cyclone - big raidwide and knockback at 50% hp
		elemental jammer - gives a random player compressed lightning that needs to be passed on to exactly one other player on expiry
			hopefully you skip this with our kill order :)
		earth missiles - after a while fire puddles will drop down leaving persistent lava goop, dodge away from them

	self-detonate - the last robot alive casts this, wiping the raid if it goes off, so make sure to bring swindler and vortexer down together

transform - big transition raidwide + knockback

flarethrower - an uncast aoe tankbuster

double rocket punch - a double stack tankbuster

short needle + long needle + seed of the sky - party starts east next to the boss to bait puddles
	one player gets marked for a stack while two get marked for preys
	meanwhile everyone takes periodic raidwide damage
	party and non-marked players move clockwise towards west while preys move away
flarethrower - MT can stack after this potentially

mega beam

super jump - jumps onto the furthest away player, stunning and knocking back anybody else caught
	have the OT bait this west

apocalyptic ray - turns towards a random player and does a multi-hit cone aoe towards them
	THIS CAN BE THE OT, MAKE SURE TO PAY ATTENTION AS PARTY MAY NOT NEED TO MOVE

intermission 1 - party pre-positions south
	j-kick - a big transition raidwide

	mirages - spawns blaster mirages on four random players that turn to random players and charge towards them
		spread out on the south edge to avoid overlapping, then WAIT UNTIL THEY TURN before moving

	100-megatonze shock - a proximity raidwide from the centre of the arena when onslaughter slams down

	weapon change (double buster) - partys moves slightly north to stack for this

	mega beam + steam chakrams - spawns four steam chakrams in random positions at the edge that fly through the arena
		dodge into a safe spot after the stack

	height + earth missiles + ice missiles - four players get ice missiles, four players get earth missiles
		spread roughly to assigned clock positions, do height properly and drop your puddle
		ice missile puddles will expand, so be careful

	mega beam
	weapon change (single buster) - stay away from MT

loops from first flarethrower after intermission until dead
	may need to stall for LB3

intermission 2 - MT prepositions north, OT SE and party south
	j-kick
	100-megatonze shock

	mines - two tank mines spawn in the middle four squares that the MT takes with invuln hopefully
		other mines spawn on the outer edges, so stay away from those
		if a mine spawns in the SE corner, OT moves ALONG THE SOUTH EDGE as this is less distance gained towards brawler
		if a mine spawns south, party moves NORTH ONE SQUARE so they don't get the far bait

	weapon change (double drill) - MT baits close and OT baits far in the SE corner
	mega beam

	mirages 2 - spawns mirages on four random players that tether to random players and either hold their hands up or crouch down
		if they hold their hands up, look away from them
		if they crouch down, look towards them

	weapon change (single drill) - stay at the edge
	steam chakrams + mega beam - OT should use tank LB3 to help this mechanic not kill everyone

	double enumerations - these will be on one tank and one healer
		essentially treat these as melee and ranged enums, and assign a priority order for each
		usually both tanks and both healers are always in
	ultra flash - vortexer spawns west and does an insta-kill aoe that needs to be line of sighted behind onslaughter's legs
		his legs are tilted slightly, beware

justice - refills brute justice's hp and grants him wings

verdict - gives everyone debuffs and spawns a lot of stuff around the arena
	assignments
		tanks
			1 - max hp + 4 final punishment
			2 - min hp + 4 final punishment
		healers
			1 - penalty 1 + 3 final punishment
			2 - penalty 2 + 1 final punishment
		dps
			1 - nisi a + 1 final punishment
			2 - nisi b + 1 final punishment
			3 & 4 - penalty 3 + 2 final punishment

	debuffs
		max hp - need to be full hp + shields
		min hp - need to be almost at death
		penalty 1, 2 & 3 - need to have this many debuffs
			INCLUDES ITSELF
		nisi a & b - need to sttack the respective add

	adds
		steam regulators A & B - these spawn east and west along with their sludge squares
		tornadoes - these spawn in the four corners
		discoid orbs - two spawn north and two spawn south

gavel - later in the phase, this checks that all debuffs have been resolved properly, otherwise it's a wipe
	tanks
		OT provokes after MT loses their final punishment stacks
		1 needs to ensure they have aggro after all final punishments are done
		1 needs to have full hp + shields
		2 needs to take SW tornado as gavel is cast to ensure they have minimum hp
	healers
		1 takes SE orb quickly, then takes the northern orbs with the nisi dps
		2 takes SE tornado once their debuff has <30 seconds left
	dps
		1 & 2 immediately go to their adds and kill them
		3 & 4 take NE and NW tornadoes once their debuffs have <30 seconds left
		1 & 2 soak an orb each with the healer
		right at the end the last south orb is taken by 3 & 4

j-kick

link-up - empowers abilities and gives one dps compressed water
	this is supposed to be a stack, but instead this dps will sacrifice themselves to the mine later
	pull boss north, party stacks east, OT west

final punch - a massive tankbuster + bind, OT needs to provoke here
final apocalypse - point this west, away from the party and MT
final beam - a big stack beam and knockback, get knocked east

long needle + seed of the sky + mine - one player gets a stack and two players get prey markers
	preys move out while the stack is resolved behind the boss
	compressed water player moves into the mine to explode it and sacrifice themselves
flarethrower

steam chakrams + enumeration - enum is always on a tank? dodge chakrams
	if not doing the sac strat, compressed water needs to be taken here too
	move away from the tornado if it has spawned

mega beam
super jump
flarethrower - if there's a tornado, point this towards it to evaporate it
short needle
final punch + final apocalypse + final beam - can potentially invuln this all
j-kick

j-waves - ramping damage pulses from the boss, kill it before you die

enrage
