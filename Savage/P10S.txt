ultima - raidwide & bleed

soul grasp - multi-hit double stack tankbuster

dividing wings - spawns two staves in the middle of the arena
steel web - one support and one dps get tethered to the staves and one other supports and dps get stack markers
	tethered players go north and slightly to the side from their staff to bait a large cone aoe
		can also go directly east/west and stack groups go dps north and supports south
		this is generally more consistent
	everyone else stacks in their respective role's stack, making sure to stay at the edge of the marker
	the stacks will tether everyone in them together with webs that need to be broken by moving through them
	if the webs are too close, they are unbreakable, and if left for too long, the players die

circles of pandaemonium/pandaemon's holy - one of two random abilities
	circles of pandaemonium - a massive doughnut aoe, not all the hitbox is safe, you need to be closer to the middle of it
	pandaemon's holy - a point-blank aoe from the boss, don't be in the hitbox

wicked step - spawns two tankbuster towers at east and west that knock any players inside flying across the arena
	tanks want to be knocked onto the small platforms opposite of their towers

entangling web - gives both tanks, one healer and one dps webs that drop beneath them after a short time
	tanks need to move close to the pegs on their platforms, and the other two players close to the corresponding pegs on the main platform
	make sure the aoes overlap, otherwise the bridge won't be made
	move away after the webs drop and tanks move over the bridge

pandaemoniac pillars - spawns eight towers in rows of 3, 3 and 2
	tanks take NE and NW, healers take centre and centre-north, melees take E and W, ranged take SE and SW
	afterwards, the towers will either chain down or float up
	chain means a point-blank, floating up means a doughnut
	the two southern towers will always do a line aoe, making that region unsafe
circles of pandaemonium/pandaemon's holy
	identify which of the two rows is safe, and dodge there

silkspit - gives every player a web aoe that tethers together if you're too close to another player
	players need to spread out on the main platform and smaller platforms to avoid tethering together
	melees take the small platforms, with dps closer to the main platform
	healers go north/south and ranged go east/west on the main platform

daemoniac bonds - gives players two out of three debuff 'sets'
	1 - every player gets a spread
	2 - all supports or all dps get stacks
	3 - one dps and one support gets a stack
	for spreads, assign positions on the small platforms for everyone, usually supports west and dps east with melees north and ranged south
	for stacks, either do pair stacks or role stacks, with supports all stacking and dps all stacking
	will always be spreads + one of the other two

pandaemoniac meltdown - a line stack on a random player and two markers on other players
	markers stay out of the stack and don't overlap their line aoes

touchdown - spawns a massive expanding black aoe in the main platform that forces all players onto the side platforms to dodge
	resolve the bonds on the small platforms

raidwide
tankbusters
daemoniac bonds 2 - always spreads and pair stacks, but a random order

pandaemoniac turrets - spawns four towers at north and four at south on the main platform
	melees take north towers, ranged take south
	tanks and ranged dps outside, healers and melee dps inside
	the turrets will then get numbered from 1 to 4, each number appearing twice
	this is the order that they will snapshot towards the closest player, doing a line stack aoe towards them
	tanks can take the lines solo, but other players need one more person with them to soak safely
	the first player in line gets a debuff meaning they cannot soak another line at all
	assign an order (usually melee > ranged > healer > tank) that players will be the first in line, and tanks ALWAYS help soak lines
	make sure players know if they're going for the leftmost or rightmost of the two numbers for their role
	in the cursed pattern (1133 4422, i.e. consecutive numbers are NOT opposite) make sure to aim the third laser diagonally towards 4, every other laser is vertical
	BONDS GO OFF RIGHT AFTER, BE PREPARED

pandaemoniac ray - a big cleave on one side of the room that leaves arcane turrets behind
	these turrets do line aoes on both sides, so make sure you're standing in the lines between them to dodge safely

silkspit
daemoniac bonds 3 - always spreads and role stacks, but a random order
pandaemoniac pillars + circles of pandaemonium/pandaemon's holy
pandaemoniac ray - bonds go off at this point, so do your spreads and stacks while dodging the cleave and line aoes
	this is INCREDIBLY tight, so try to pre-position as much as possible and spread into as many safe spots as you can, to avoid clumping up in one line

dividing wings 2 - this time the wings spawn on the small platforms
	tethers MAY go onto players in the opposite group, in this case only tethered players adjust not the groups
steel web - dps will go onto the east platform, supports onto the west platform
touchdown - bait the cleaves SOUTH while the stacks go more north on the small platforms
	don't forget to stay at the edges to keep your webs breakable, a triangle formation is recommended

dividing wings 3 - staves are in the middle again now
pandaemoniac web - three players get marked for entangling web puddles while one player gets a steel web stack
pandaemon's holy - players with puddles go directly south while the stack stays middle, outside of the hitbox
	south players make sure that the outer players overlap with the pegs AND the inner player, inner player overlap with both, otherwise the web wall won't be created
	tethered players bait the cleaves directly east/west to avoid hitting others
	after the steel web goes off, those players get entangling web puddles
	quickly break them free, then they place their puddles south again
	DO NOT BREAK THE SOUTH WEB
	instead, place the puddles very slightly north, but still making sure they overlap with each other and the pegs

daemoniac bonds 4 - fully random again

harrowing hell - a gigantic multi-hit raidwide that deals higher damage to the closest two players
	make sure tanks are in front and mitigate as much as you can
	tank LB3 can make this a lot safer
	there's a knockback at the end, make sure you get knocked back towards your role side (supports west, dps east) as bonds go off immediately after you regain control

parted plumes - spawns a puddle in the centre of the platform that shoots out two rotating cone aoes
	start on the final one and quickly move into the first after it's fired
	exactly the same as normal, just a bit faster

harrowing hell - technically a soft enrage, you can mitigate through the damage but the knockback pushes everyone off as there's no wall
