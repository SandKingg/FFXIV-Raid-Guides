dust bluster - knockback from the centre of the room

fresh puff - spawns three puffs at north, SE and SW that are either blue or yellow
bracing suds - boss becomes green
squeaky clean - does two small front cleaves, then a front/side cleave
	dodge behind then to the side he first lands on
	this also paints any puff it hits green
chilling suds - boss becomes blue
slippery soap - a line stack on a random player that paints puffs, but will not hit behind the player that got marked
	the boss moves towards the marked player and does a random effect on everyone it hits based on the colour of the suds
	chilling (blue) - deep freeze, make sure you're moving
	bracing (green) - knockback
	fizzling (yellow) - forked lightning, spread out
	then the boss executes the sud effect from its position
	blue causes line aoes to fire at cardinals from the boss's position
	look at the non-green puff
		if blue - take the stack to the SW/SE green
		if yellow - take the stack north
carpet beater - tankbuster and the boss jumps to the tank
soaping spree - causes all puffs to execute mechanics based on their colour
	green causes a doughnut aoe centred on that puff
	everyone stack under the remaining green puff

total wash - heavy raidwide + bleed

chilling/bracing suds
fresh puff 2 - spawns four puffs at cardinals or intercardinals, two blue (opposite) and two yellow (opposite)

		green cardinal - yellow out to edge, blue sideways away from mid
		green intercardinal - yellow sideways towards mid, blue out to edge
		blue cardinal - all out to edge, safe spots relative left and right of the yellows
		blue intercardinal - all out to corners, safe spots diagonally in front of the yellows
