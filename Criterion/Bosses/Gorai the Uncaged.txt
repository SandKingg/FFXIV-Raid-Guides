unenlightenment - raidwide with a fiery dot

seal of scurrying sparks - marks two players with aoes, need to split into support/dps or melee/ranged pairs
	assign two 'flexers' and two 'statics', one static gets NW priority and the other gets SE priority
	the flexers switch based on which pair it is
	this will help on future mechs too
flame and suplhur - summons fiery line aoes and rocky point-blank aoes
brazen ballad - either expands or splits the aoes, look at the boss
	purple means expand, go to one of the corners away from a rock (2 safe spots always opposite corners)
	blue means split, go to one of the rocks with a line fully going through it

impure purgation - big cone aoes towards each player, move after they hit to dodge the second hit

thundercall - summons six orbs (four in the corners, two in the middle) that will do point blank aoes
humble hammer - marks the healer with a purple marker that will shrink them and any orb they are near, go near the orb away from the rest to make a safe zone
flintlock - a big line aoe targeted on the marked healer, tank needs to soak with a cooldown while dps stay away

torching torment - tankbuster with a fiery dot

rousing reincarnation - each player gets two debuffs that are either 1 3 or 2 4, then also either orange or blue
malformed prayer - towers spawn in sequence in a circular pattern near the middle
pointed purgation - two switchable tethers that do cone aoes on their targets
	the debuff numbers tell you which order people take towers and the colours tell you to take the same-coloured tower
	if not soaking then take a tether and point it away from others

raidwide

seal of scurrying sparks 2 - marks everyone with a spread and 2 players with a stack, split into pairs, look if spread or stack first
cloud to ground - spawns 4 exaflares in mid that go to the middle of each edge, then 2 exaflares each on 2 opposite edges that go across to the other side
	use the flexer/static assignments to decide which sides to go to
	statics will always be in the corner safe spot for spreads, flexers will always be in the middle safe spot for spreads

fighting spirits - knockback while 1-4 limit cut markers appear
	1 gets knocked north, 2 gets knocked east, 3 gets knocked west, 4 gets knocked southwest
	boss jumps on players in number order then back to mid, doing a massive plus shaped aoe each time (getting hit by 2 kills you)
	every runs to a corner after taking their jump, 4 also runs to south after 2's jump

tankbuster

malformed reincarnation - players get 4 debuffs: the first indicates the colour of the tower they place under them, then the final 3 indicate the order of the towers to soak
	of the final 3, either all will be the same or the final one will be different
	either all players have the 'different' set or 2 have 'same' 2 have 'different'
		if all have different, use the support/dps or melee/ranged pairs as before
		if 2 have same, then those players get NW prio, the different players get SE prio
malformed prayer 2 - creates 2 sets of 4 towers, 4 in mid, then 1 in each corner
	one half of the room will be orange, one blue
	players go to opposite edges, such that for each pair, one player can be on the orange side and one on the blue side
	'same' players stand in the same colour as their tower drop, 'different' players stand in the opposite colour
	then, soak the towers in this order:
		mid, diagonally from your tower drop
		closest corner
		tower your pair partner dropped
	dodge the two checkerboard aoes too
