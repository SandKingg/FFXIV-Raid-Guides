show of strength - raidwide

infern brand - creates two portal lines in north and two in south in a plus formation
	fireballs will travel through the portals later and do point-blank aoes
cryptic portal - indicates which directions the portals will rotate in, and prevents players from travelling through portals
	have melees go north and ranged go south
	supports will go opposite where the vertical portal rotates to, at the edge on the south/north corner of the top-most/bottom-most tile
	dps need to flex either diagonally opposite to supports or, if that will be exploded on, directly east/west in the middle of the two tiles

firesteel strike - the boss jumps to two random players, giving magic vulns and knocking anyone else hit far away

blessed beacon - does a line aoe towards the players that got jumped on, in the same order
	players without vulns need to stand in front of them (one each)

firesteel fracture - cone aoe tankbuster

infern brand 2 - spawns two sets of four numbered lines, one orange and one blue and gives everyone a debuff 1 to 4
	players need to move to the quadrant closest to both of their numbered lines (always NE/SW?)
	also two sets of line aoes spawn at the edges, one before the other, use this to decide which tethers to cut first
cryptic flames - activates the debuffs
	players need to cut in the order 1, 2, 3, 4
	cutting gives a magic vuln so be careful
	then dodge the first set of lines and wait for the vulns to drop off
cast shadow - spawns two sets of six cone aoes that go off one after each other
	dodge first, then cut, don't rush
	cut the second set and dodge line aoes

infern brand 3 - spawns four portals, two north and two south along with four staves, two outer and two inner, and laser lines for later
infern wave - activates the two sets of staves, either outer first or inner first
	eventually, each staff fires two large cones towards the closest two players
banishment - indicates the rotation directions of each portal and gives every player a rotating portal along with a debuff that must be cleansed by going through a portal
	one portal out of each set (north/south) is safe, both players must go through that one first
	either stand on the start (inner first) or where the end rotates to (outer first)
	to work out whether to go north or south (for inner first, reverse for outer first):
		Blue East - North
		Blue West - South
		Orange East - South
		Orange West - North
infern ward - activates the laser aoes
	after teleporting, one player moves across the staff to bait the second cone
	then your portals take you across the lasers to bait the second staff's cones

tankbuster

infern brand 4 + cryptic portals 2 - spawns three portals at east, mid and west with line aoes attached to them
	the portals rotate giving four tiles as safe spots
	assign each player intercardinal priority, i.e. they go to the 'northwest-most safe spot' etc.

infern brand 5 + infern wave 2 - spawns four staves at the cardinals, along with four sets of two lines (two orange sets, two blue sets)
	players also get the 1234 debuffs again
	watch which staff glows first, that sets the order for the whole mechanic
cryptic flames 2 - the 3 and 4 players will bait the first staff (pre-position), while the 1 and 2 players cut the lines in front of it
	3 and 4 then cut the lines opposite to allow 1 and 2 to bait the next staff
pure fire - a puddle underneath each player, 1 and 2 stay to bait while 3 and 4 go back to their staff to bait so mid is free
	wait for magic vulns before 1 and 2 cut the next lines so 3 and 4 can bait
cast shadow - dodge the cones
	3 and 4 wait for vulns then cut the lines, while 1 and 2 quickly bait
