tidal roar - raidwide + bleed

spring crystals 1 - places four crystals that do line aoes, lines are based on the thick faces not the thin ones
bubble net - encases every crystal in a bubble and gives players one of two debuffs, also does a lot of damage
	bubble - will be encased in a bubble when it expires
	bind - will be bound when it expires
hydro ability - either hydrofall or hydrobullet
	hydrofall - a stack on either both dps or both supports
	hydrobullet - a spread on everyone
fluke gale - marks each quadrant with either a 1 or 2, signifying the order in which the gales will push things in bubbles
	first, identify crystal safe spots (which can be done as soon as they spawn) by treating them as two pairs, vertical and horizontal
	if the two crystals in a pair are 2 rows/columns apart then the safe rows/columns are the other two
	if the two crystals in a pair are 3 rows/columns apart then the safe rows/columns are those
	then, if spreads, every player starts in a 2 quadrant with binds standing in a safe spots and bubbles getting pushed 2 squares to a safe spot in the 1 quadrants
	if stacks, binds go to the safe spots in 1 quadrants and bubbles go 2 squares away and get pushed to them

hydrofall/hydrobullet - can be in either order, look at which is first (stack is always both dps?)
blowing bubbles - creates sets of bubbles on the outer edges that move through the arena
hydrobomb - puddles appear one after another under every player
	if spread first, assign each player a quadrant to stay in to dodge bubbles and puddles, then slowly move to mid to stack with their pair
	if stack first, both players dodge in the same quadrant, then one moves mid and back to that quadrant, while the other follows behind the bubbles on the outer edge

hydrofall
strewn bubbles - creates two sets of four watery line aoes that cover two squares each, the second set covering the safe spots from the first
twintides - either encroaching or receding
	encroaching twintides - in, then out
	receding twintides - out, then in
	dodge with your stack pair

hydrobullet
roar - summons four adds near mid in each of the cardinals
spring crystals 2 - summons four line aoe crystals
	safe spots could be all corner squares, north/south mid squares or east/west mid squares
bubble net - assign pairs (one bubble, one bind per pair), also encases two adds in bubbles
updraft - will send everything in a bubble upwards
	the adds will turn to closest players and cast hundred lashings, a big cleave
	binds need to bait bubbled adds and vice versa
	assign N/W and E/S priority to the pairs (treat corners consistently as one or the other)
	'correct' player in the pair spreads to the back corner in the direction we rotate
	'incorrect' player spreads in the front corner closest to the direction they need to rotate to bait the add
	in case both directions are correct, go clockwise

hydrofall/hydrobullet - look which comes first
angry seas - a big knockback from the centre line that leaves a line aoe bisecting the arena
spring crystals 3 - spawns spherical crystals that do aoes
bubble net - encases the aoe crystals in bubbles, along with spawning empty bubbles and towers
	there will be three towers on one side and one on the other, assign one player to take a bubble to the other side
fluke typhoon - a big gust of wind pushes everything bubbled to one side of the arena
	make sure the bubbled player is in line with a tower not covered by an aoe
	dodge first then take towers

spring crystals 4 - same as crystals 1
bubble net + hydro ability + fluke gale
hydrofall + strewn bubbles + twintides 2
