inferno theorem - raidwide

angular addition - grants the boss a 3 or 5 buff that shows how many times he rotates 90 degrees
	treat them as -1 and 1 respectively
arcane blight - does a 270-degree cleave that rotates in a specific direction base don the angular addition debuff

analysis - gives everyone a mustadio-esque 'unseen' debuff, point your hole towards specific mechanics
arcane array - spawns two sets of creeping tiles in opposite corners that slowly fill in four out of five rows/columns
	also spawns two orbs that explode when the tiles reach them
	point your hole towards the orbs as they explode
angular addition - also gives each player a 3 or 5, check which way your hole rotates
arcane blight - careful of the creeping tiles here, don't stand in them
targeted light - ensure your hole gets rotated to point towards the boss at the end

strategic strike - tankbuster

planar tactics - gives everyone a forced march (forward) and a 3 or 5 debuff, along with a debuff that requires you to get hit a certain amount of times
	one player needs 1, two players need 2, one player needs 3
	additionally, two players get a stack
arcane mine - spawns a pattern of eight tiles with one corner of the 3x3 missing [https://raidplan.io/plan/CvYKFFetf2O-oG80]
	taking the missing tile as NW, there are two patterns:
	pattern 1 - exactly one 2 has a stack
		3 goes SE, angles to move north, in tile stay middle east
		1 goes NW, angles to move east, in tile stay NW at the edge
		one 2 goes mid-W, angles to move east, in tile stay SW at the edge
		other 2 goes SW, angles to move east, in tile stay NW at the edge
	pattern 2 - both 2s or neither 2 have stacks
		3 goes NE, angles to move south, in tile stay SE
		1 goes NW, angles to move east, in tile stay SW at the edge
		one 2 goes mid-W, angles to move east, in tile stay NW at the edge
		other 2 goes SW, angles to move east, in tile stay SW at the edge

raidwide
tankbuster

spatial tactics - gives everyone a debuff showing how many times they need to get hit: 1, 2, 3 or 4 times
arcane array 2 - spawns two sets of creeping tiles in opposite corners, along with one orb and six cubes
	the orbs explode when touched by a tile, hitting EVERYONE
	this means you subtract 1 from your debuff to see how many cubes you get hit by
	the cubes explode bomberman-style, 2 and 3 get easy jobs as they can stay in the row hit by 1 and 2 cubes respectively
	4 needs to dodge into a 3rd row and 1 needs to dodge away from cubes
angular addition + arcane blight

raidwide x2

symmetric surge - marks two players for stacks (always both dps?)
constructive figure - spawns three golems on one side that will eventually do line aoes through their respective rows/columns
arcane plot - spawns two more creeping tiles that will make two columns/rows unsafe (always perpendicular to golems)
arcane point - marks every player, causing them to drop a tile underneath them
	at this point there is a 2x4 grid safe from the tiles and two 1x2 parts of that safe from golems, drop tiles there
	one pair (melees?) take the mid-most tiles, the other pair (ranged?) take the outermost tiles
	after dropping the tiles, everyone moves the same direction into their new safe spots
explosive theorem - marks everyone for a spread aoe that should be placed in two corners adjacent on the LONG edge (i.e. spread aprt but NOT diagonally opposite)
	these drop puddles too, so go to the safe spot afterwards for the stack
	healing/mits is very heavy here
