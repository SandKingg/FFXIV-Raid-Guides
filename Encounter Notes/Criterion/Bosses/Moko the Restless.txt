kenki release - raidwide

triple kasumi-giri - a series of 3 270-degree cleaves, look at the safespot indicator to know RELATIVE TO THE BOSS' POSITION where the safe spot is
	boss turns after every cleave, always ends up facing directly opposite of the safe spot
	if water, need to be in; if fire, need to be out
triple kasumi-giri

lateral slice - cone tankbuster

scarlet auspice - point blank fire aoe, get out of the hitbox
boundless scarlet - creates two diagonal lines through the middle and two lines at the north and south edges, go to the sides to dodge
	eventually these lines explode in very large aoes
invocation of vengeance - marks everyone with a spread and two players with a stack, assign support dps or melee/ranged pairs
fleeting iai-giri - one player is tethered to the boss signalling he will jump to them and do a cleave, look at the indicator to see how to orient yourself
	the jump will always be behind the player and facing towards them
	run to the first safe corner (away from first explosions) and bait the cleave + do spread/stack
	WAIT FOR SPREAD/STACK AND AOES
	run to the second corner and do the other stack/spread

raidwide

shadow-twin - boss creates two clones that tether to two players, split into pairs again so that each pair has one tethered player
	clones will always do first cleave in front, then second cleave random, tethered players look for second cleave safe spot
moonless night - summons two hands either north/south or east/west that do massive aoes
	assign N/W and E/S priority to each pair
near edge/far edge - the closest/furthest two players get a small aoe bind around them
	can also look at boss, if the icon above his head is close then untethered players stay close, if apart then stay far
	pairs go into the safe directions, making sure the untethered player is closest for near edge or furthest for far edge
	the tethered player should bait their clone to make sure the untethered player is safe, then both dodge the second cleave

moonless night + near/far edge 2 - the two players who didn't get tethers before, get tethers here so keep same pairs
	hands spawned are random, may need to change corners
	the rest of the mechanic is the same

azure auspice - doughnut water aoe, get into the hitbox
boundless azure - creates two diagonal lines through the middle and two lines at the north and south edges, go to the sides to dodge
	eventually these lines start propagating outwards one at a time

triple kasumi-giri

soldiers of death - summons soldiers around the arena that do aoes on the ground, red ones do normal aoes and the blue one does a big aoe
	look for the blue soldier to see which two cardinals are safe
	will always be one of north/south and one of east/west
shadow-twin 2 - summons four clones in the arena that tether to each player
	this time the first cleave is semi-random, either left or right safe and the second cleave is always behind safe
	supports will always get opposite safe spots for their first cleaves, same for dps
	assign supports and dps north/south or east/west priority
	players should stand with in the corner of their safe zone and look out at the side walls
