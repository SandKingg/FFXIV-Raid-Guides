aero iv - raidwide

trick reload - loads eight bullets into her gun
	the first and last bullets are spread (loaded) or stack (bonked), always opposite of each other
	the middle six show which aegments are unsafe (loaded) or safe (bonked), there will always be one safe segment

trapshooting - stack/spread as appropriate

trigger happy - move into the safe segment

ring a ring o' explosions - forms a pattern of six bombs, five around the outside and one in the middle, linked by two triangles with one bomb glowing
	the glowing bomb indicates that EVERY bomb in that triangle will explode
	move into the safe triangle

trapshooting - spread/stack as appropriate
trick reload
ring a ring o' explosions

dartboard of dancing explosives - turns the arena into a dartboard and gives three random players a dart debuff
	the bombs will also rotate around the outside 3 or 4 times
	at the end, players with darts need to be on three different colours
	assign one dps to flex, then have tank on blue, healer on yellow, dps on red
	flex dps goes to the colour that doesn't have a dart

trapshooting

surprise balloon - spawns two massive balloons in east and west that will eventually explode and knock players back
	use knockback resist for this (use it slightly after beguiling glitter is cast to dodge first kb)

beguiling glitter - gives every player a forced march debuff for later

trigger happy + surprise needles - small line aoes fly at players or the balloons
	they will pop the balloons, causing the knockbacks

trapshooting - forced march activates right before this, assign spots for spreads and mid for stack
raidwide

intermission - spawns more bombs in a similar pattern to before and two surprising missiles around the edge
	present box - summons many irritating objects
		four surprising staves on the cardinals will do faerie ring doughnut aoes, meaning only the intercardinals are safe
		two seeking claws will tether to players while the missiles tether to the other players
		these claws slowly move towards players, instantly killing them if they get too close
		missiles will eventually do massive aoes centred on their tethered players
		one of each role will get a claw and a missile
	fireworks - summons chains on the missiled players, and a two-person enumeration on one of the clawed players
		free player and enumeration player move to the intercardinal opposite the one that is exploded by a bomb, kiting their claws
		chains start directly mid, then go towards the two opposite intercardinals remaining
	the pattern may work out that the safe spots are a lot tighter or looser than others, so be careful

shocking abandon - tankbuster

pinwheeling dartboard - turns the arena into a dartboard again, giving two players dart debuffs and having a fixed dart spot on the inner circle somewhere
	three flares spawn at 120 degrees to each other and will start rotating around the arena, one flare always starts north or south
	find the flare whose outer segments are both different colours to the fixed dart spot, this is relative north
fireworks - this time the chains will randomly target one dps and one support and the enumeration targets another random player
	default supports run east, dps run west
	enumerations will run directly north (relative) and stand together on different segments
	if both dps or both supports have a dart, enumeration players swap segments
	meanwhile, chained players wait mid, then run directly east/west to break chains before moving very slightly south into their segments
	keep dodging flares afterwards

raidwide
beguiling glitter - gives two different forced march timings, a short and a long one
trick reload
trapshooting
present box - spawns the four surprising staves from the intermission
ring a ring o' explosions
trigger happy - shorter forced marches need to move into the safe segment while dodging the doughnuts, ignore bombs for now
trapshooting - longer forced marches need to resolve the stack/spread and dodge bombs
