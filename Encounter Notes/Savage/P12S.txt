-- PHASE 1 --
on the soul - raidwide

paradeigma - spawns four anthropoi from yellow octahedra either in north or south
	these target the two nearest players with lasers that give magic vuln
	the easy strat is just to have tanks stack on the anthropoi side and invuln
		beware that the MT will have a magic vuln for the next autoattack so needs either a quick swap or heavy mitigation
	the normal strat is to have supports bait first, with tanks closer, while the dps stay away then swap over
trinity of souls - causes one of each of her three sets of wings to be indicated with a thorny circle
	she then does a big half-room cleave on the sides indicated by the circles
	if the rings appear starting at the bottom, she also between each cleave, so for the second you dodge INTO the side the circle indicated
	if the rings appear starting at the top, it's the same as normal

paradeigma 2 - spawns four anthropoi from blue 'gemstone shapes' and two from red dodecahedra
	the four blueborn anthropoi tether to four players with either light or dark tethers that need to be stretched
	each role will get one light tether and one dark tether
engravement of souls - gives the four untethered players either a light or a dark debuff
	again, each role gets one light debuff and one dark debuff
	this debuff spawns a tower when it expires that needs to be taken by a player with the opposite element tether
	after taking the towers, the red anthropoi will do two line aoes through the arena, make sure to dodge

raidwide

glaukopis - a double hit line tankbuster that gives magic vuln, make sure to swap during the cast

superchain theory i - spawns an arrangement of shapes that tether to activation spheres before moving towards them
	green sphere - a point blank aoe
	blue doughnut - a doughnut aoe
	orange stellated shape - cone aoes on every player that give magic vuln, assign clock spots
	purple six-pointed shape - shareable cones on all supports or all dps, assign pairs
engravement of souls - gives a big array of debuffs to everyone
	either all supports or all dps will get spread debuffs
		they will also get a light or dark aligned debuff
	from the non-spread role
		two players get marked for line stacks, one dark and one light
		two players get marked for tower spawning, one dark and one light

	the first pair of shapes is in/out + pairs/clocks
	quickly run to the doughnut and separate into stacks for the two line aoes
		the dark line stack needs the three light players in it and vice versa
	the final pair is in and out in either order
	after this the final debuffs go off in quick succession
		towers spawn and need to be taken by the non-spread role
		then spreads go off, melees should run through the boss and ranged run away

trinity of souls

peri/apodialogos - jumps towards a player, doing a shared tankbuster and leaving a bleed
	also does a stack on another player
	peri - jumps to closest, stack on furthest
		have tanks stay mid while everyone else stacks at the edge of the hitbox
	apo - jumps to furthest, stack on closest
		have tanks run to the edge while everyone else stays mid

raidwide

paradeigma 3 - spawns four anthropoi from blue 'gemstone shapes' and two from yellow octahedra
engravement of souls - gives debuffs to all supports
	one gets a plus aoe, one gets a cross aoe and the other two players spawn towers of the same element
unnatural enchainment - gives life to four panels in a zigzag pattern, killing anyone on them and removing them from the arena
	also spawns one tower on each of the safe platforms which are taken by supports usually
	the light and dark tethers of the same element will always come from the same side, make sure to stretch them
		these tethers need to be crossed to avoid clipping players
		if the tether can be stretched perfectly horizontally, do so, otherwise adjust
	the two aoe players should go to the front and back platforms and take the towers there
	the two tower players take the towers on the middle platforms
	after the towers, the plus goes to the outside corner while the cross goes to the inside corner
		after that, these two players need to bait the lasers from the yellowborn anthropoi
		the two players not spawning or taking towers also need to bait the lasers
	the other players need to make sure the towers are soaked by players with opposite-element tethers
		have the tower player on the platform with the correct elements just place it near the middle
		the tower player on the platform with incorrect elements needs to place it right in the middle corner so the players on the other platform can reach it
		convention is that 'crossed' tether player soaks the middle tower

raidwide - respawns the platforms
tankbusters

ultima blade - a big transition raidwide

palladion - marks every player with a number from 1 to 8 and dashes between them, doing proximity damage that needs to be shared by two players
	each dash also leaves a persistent puddle behind
	have 1 and 3 pair, 2 and 4 pair etc, this means odds will be opposite of where the boss starts and evens will be closer towards it
	the eight adds will spawn mid, doing cleaves to prevent anyone from being mid and firing lasers at the two closest players
	the baits should be some semi-opposite to the dashes
		5 and 7 first, then 6 and 8, then 1 and 3, then finally 2 and 4
		make sure you spread a bit when baiting so you don't overlap the lasers

theos's ultima - destroys the middle four platforms, then does a massive raidwide split between all players alive (and respawns the platforms)

superchain theory iia - spawns another array of shapes with three activation spheres in north, mid and south
	the first is always pairs
	the second is always in
	the third is either clocks or pairs
trinity of souls - look which side is getting cleaved first and solve the first shapes on the safe side
	quickly move in when running to the final activation sphere, staying on the safe side from the cleaves
	then keep running and solve the final shape

peri/apodialogos
raidwide

superchain theory iib - spawns another array of shapes with six activation spheres towards the cardinals, one pair of cardinals having doubles
	the first two go off at the same time, one in and one out
	the second two go off at the same time, one out and either clocks or pairs for the other
	the final two spawn very close to the first two, one out and one in/out + pairs/clocks
paradeigma 4 - spawns two anthropoi from red dodecahedra
	start on the doughnut activation sphere
parthenos - does a big line aoe in front and behind her
	run to the side which doesn't have the sphere and do clocks/pairs
	immediately dodge the line aoes from the redborn anthropoi
	then run to the final activation sphere and do clocks/pairs in or out

unnatural enchainment 2 - destroys 7 of the 8 platforms, leaving just one next to the final activation sphere of the previous mechanic
raidwide - respawns the platforms too
