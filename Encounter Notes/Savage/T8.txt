diffusion ray - an untelegraphed cleave on the MT that gives an esunable bleed

towers (north + west) - periodically, towers placed at the four cardinals will activate and begin charging
	if two towers charge to the same level together, the boss gains a stack of damage up and vuln down
	if two towers reach full charge together, it's a wipe
	if a player stands in the  indicated area next to a tower, they immediately increase its charge by 1, take some damage and get a vuln
		this vuln ONLY affects taking towers, nothing else
	each tower will do something when it reaches full charge
	north - spawns a dreadnaught add that needs to be killed, careful of its cleaves
	east - spawns three landmines that need to be soaked by the OT
	south - raidwide
	west - raidwide
	assign three players to be tower soakers, with a potential backup for later
	for the two tower patterns, the player assigned to the towers in priority N > E > W will charge their respective tower once

homing missile - a random player gets tethered to the boss, which will cause them to explode later and deal aoe damage
	this tether can be intercepted by anyone

gaseous bomb - a stack on a random player, indicated by a white-ish icon

dreadnaught - should be picked up by the OT and killed

defensive reaction - tower raidwide

landmines - OT should sprint around and soak these
	they knockback any player near them, so be careful when soaking

ballistic missile - targets two random players, binding them and giving them either a small or a big circle
	small circles require exactly two players, big circles require exactly three
		if this is not satisfied, everyone in the circles dies
	everyone should be stacked up (except MT) and immediately spread once the circles spawn
	assign three players in priority order to help for the big circles
		player 2 goes in if player 1 is bound, player 3 goes in if both player 1 and 2 are bound
	2 small - nobody goes in, the two players satisfy their own circles
	1 small, 1 big - player goes into the big circle, being careful not to also be in the small circle
	2 big - player goes into the circles

towers (north + west)

brainjack - mind controls the MT, causing them to run towards and auto-attack the closest player
	assign one player to 'tank' the MT, they should stand inside the boss's hitbox and slightly south
	this way the boss never turns and cleaves the party, and the 'tank tank' also doesn't get cleaved

allagan field - debuffs a random player, which explodes at the end of its duration, amplifying all damage taken by that player in a raidwide
	this person should not take ANY damage
	they should never take a tether, never step in a tower, but they can take a ballistic missile as successfully doing it deals 0 damage

homing missile - the tether now always goes onto the allagan field player at first, so needs to be taken away

towers (east + south + west) - now there are three towers that need activating
	using the same priorities as before, the top priority tower needs two players to charge it twice and the second priority tower needs charging once
	the player whose tower is not activated will be the second player into the tower
	if a tower-taker has allagan field, the backup needs to take it instead
