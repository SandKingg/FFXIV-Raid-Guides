-- PHASE 1 --
dualcast + blizzard iii - two sets of puddles under 5 random players each, can stack to minimise movement

dualcast + thunder iii - a double tankbuster, needing a swap and mitigation

dualcast + fire iii - spread aoes on all dps, then all supports, don't overlap

white hole - petrifies anyone not at full hp and kills anyone under half hp

the decisive battle - mini-phase, summons roots and exdeath's tree form

	make sure to stand slightly in front of the root to not die to the proximity or knockback
	immediately move to dodge the cleaves
	holy - a stack marker on a random player
	flares appear on one tank, healer and dps
		can have healers stay still, tank flare rotate backwards and dps flare keep rotating

	void + fire iii - pyretic, stay still
	void + blizzard iii - deep freeze, keep moving
	void + thunder iii - massive point blank, run away

vacuum wave - massive knockback
white hole

black hole + dual fire iii + holy - summons multiple static black holes and inflicts hp penalty on everyone

	if anybody touches a black hole, they instantly die and the hole disappears
	have supports go to cardinals and rotate around the arena
	dps stay near the middle on intercardinals for spreads
	after support spreads, quickly go to middle to stack

	forked lightning - a lightning point blank on these players
	off-balance
	acceleration bomb
	black/white wound
strat
	take neo exdeath's position as 'north'
	healer with forked goes 1 marker clockwise of 'north'
	tank with gaze + forked goes 1 marker clockwise of 'south'
	healer with stack and dps with death go 'south'
	dps with acceleration bomb stay 'north'
	look 'north' to avoid the gazes, stack will knock people from 'south' to 'north'
flood of naught (random) - dps with death fail, others do correctly

raidwide
minibuster

earth shaker - two cone aoes on the top 2 in enmity, go to each side and use a cooldown
vacuum wave - a point blank centred on the boss, move away

	acceleration bomb
	allagan field
	forked lightning
	compressed water
	cursed shriek
the final battle - neo exdeath disappears and reappears in 3 directions, casting floods of naught
	everyone stacks mid for hysteria, then play like light and darkness
	take 'north' as where neo exdeath was before disappearing
	forkeds go to the same role spots as light and darkness
	stack and non-forkeds stay 'north'
	then, deaths need to fail one of the floods of naught while everyone else does them correctly
	remember to be close to the boss for failing since you get knocked back with off-balance
	after all three floods of naught, stay still and look away from gazes
		gazes can try to be middle to make it easier
flood of naught (terminal) - finally, play this like the end of grand cross alpha
