	eight orbs different heights - two rotating aoes around the arena, dodge into the second explosion from mid

whirlwind - raidwide

spin crusher - a dodgeable cone aoe in front of the boss, MT should move behind it

limit cut - marks every player with a number from 1 to 8 then cleaves towards odds and dashes towards evens
	1, 2, 3 and 4 go to their markers first then 5, 6, 7 & 8 replace them after
	have the odds look outside the arena to bait the cleaves away since the boss appears behind them
	the evens should look towards the previous number to avoid the knockback from the charge
	go back to mid once your job has been completed
	each limit cut also gives the boss a damage up stack

photon - reduces some players to 1 hp, this time it's 1 tank, 1 healer and 2 dps

blastoff - a small raidwide and the boss goes untargetable, four open ducts appears allowing you to mount the boss
	make sure to press the button to release when you can
	the arena will have a death wall when you return

limit cut 2 - the boss goes untargetable again and four lapis lazulis spawn that must be killed
	pick one to start at and go clockwise
plasmasphere - an orb appears that tethers to the OT and moves towards them
	these orbs reduce in size and damage the longer they travel and explode into an aoe puddle when touching their tethered player
	if these puddles ever overlap, it's a wipe
	OT can cooldown and immediately soak the first orb where it spawns
clasters - these do line aoes towards random players
raidwide
plasmaspheres - two random dps
laser x sword - a shareable tankbuster that also knocks you back
plasmaspheres - both healers

{skips to here at ~60% hp}
eternal darkness - a big raidwide that wipes you if the lapis lazulis weren't destroyed in time
	also makes the arena fiery and gives every player a pyretic

optical sight

limit cut 3 - the boss goes untargetable and spawns a plasma shield that must be destroyed from the front
blassty charge - after destroying the shield, the boss charges a random player so spread out and keep looking at the boss to avoid the knockback
	this also leaves a nasty bleed if the player is not shielded, so be careful

blastoff 2 - removes the death wall and the railings, but spawns three generators on the arena
	the generators take damage from all the boss's abilities and if all three die, the platform is destroyed and it's a wipe
	you'll want to intentionally sacrifice one generator to allow more space for mechanics

ga-100 - use this to sacrifice the south generator
optical sight x2 - always point-blank and shivas, but in a random order
raidwide x2
tankbuster
optical sight - always baits, make sure you don't bait next to a generator
photon - targets everyone except the main tank

propeller wind - an aoe confusion from the boss, hide behind one of the generators to dodge

limit cut 4 - same as 1, but make sure not to destroy the generators
	hopefully the sacrificed generator has given enough space for the charges
