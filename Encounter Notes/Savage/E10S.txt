deepshadow nova - raidwide

implosion - look at boss to determine front or back
	raised head = front, raised tail = back
	look at shadow to determine position
		the graphic is showing the shadow's BACK i.e. if graphic is southern, shadow faces NORTH
		can turn camera to behind graphic and go from there

throne of shadow - the boss stands up and does a big, untelegraphed point-blank aoe

giga slash - boss raises up one hand, then shadow slashes that side of the arena

umbra smash - 4 hit big tankbuster, use invuln and swap before 2nd part (green marker)
2nd part - either shadow's edge or darkness unleashed
	shadow's edge - big line aoe
	darkness unleashed - targeted group soak, NOT with the first tank

shadow cleave - targeted cone aoes on each player, spread to clocks and place them close to the edge
	also creates clones directly on each player that tether to them
	these clones will do cleaves towards players if they are too close, so stay away
	two clones at a time get numbered with 1, 2, 3
dualspell - a three hit stack
	players with the respective numbered clone get magic vulns with that hit so they should stay out i.e. 1 players out on 1st hit, 2 players out on 2nd hit etc.
shadowkeeper - all clones 'nothing personell' behind players before doing a small cone in front of them
	start max melee at N/S, then rotate clockwise

tankbuster combo

shadow servant + giga slash - all dps or all supports get shadows on them
	look at the unsafe side, then position so that your shadow cleaves the outside
	once again, the graphic shows the shadow's BACK i.e. if graphic is western, shadow faces EAST
	tips:
		east/west-facing shadows go to the north/south of the boss and vice versa (which specific compass point depends on cleave side)
		all shadows should point either clockwise (right cleave) or anticlockwise (left cleave)
	players get bound, then should run into the middle after it wears off

shadow servant + giga slash 2 - the other 4 players get their turn

distant scream - the boss sits down, doing a raidwide + knockback (can use kb immune once sword poofs)

umbral orbs - 2 solo purple orbs and 2 orange orb clumps spawn on cardinals, then eventually slam into the closest player/s
	purple need to be tanked, orange need to be stacked
	split into 2 light parties, 1 starts north, 1 starts south
	the 'correct' player/s stay/s north or south and the 'incorrect' player/s rotate/s to their correct side
	if opposite orbs are the same, always go clockwise, other patterns it's obvious

spawn shadow + shadow warrior - four clones spawn at cardinals and jump 5 times, including potential double backs
	follow the clone that got tethered to the boss then stand at that edge
umbral orbs 2 - assign relative leftmost/rightmost orbs to tanks and light parties then stand in those positions on the safe edge to be the closest players

raidwide

fade to shadow - spawns 4 puddles in the corners, 2 with straight tethers and 2 with curved tethers
	puddles explode once the pulse goes along the tether and reaches them
implosion - this makes one side unsafe
	stand in a corner with a CURVED tether, away from the implosion
	then rotate to avoid the other implosions

raidwide
implosion (quadruple) - all 4 use the same telegraph (head or tail) so dodge all the same way
raidwide
throne of shadow
tankbuster combo

voidgate + shadow servant - four puddles spawn that need to be soaked by 2 players each
	loosely assign spots for each player, then the ones that get shadow servant adjust to their correct position and take the closest puddle
giga slash - run in after soaking the puddles puddles
voidgate 2 + shadow servant + giga slash - rotate clockwise from 1st soak to get starting positions
	soak the intercardinal puddles first, then adjust to shadow servant positions

pitch bog - every player gets an aoe that drops a puddle after a few seconds, standing in this puddle spawns a clone
	these should be placed in specific spots near the cardinals (i.e. keep intercardinals safe) with supports slightly clockwise of cardinals and dps long clockwise from their intercardinals
umbral orbs 3 + distant scream - same as 1 but on the intercardinals this time, 1 light party starts NE, 1 starts SW and rotate from there
	knockback immune AFTER prepositioning, timing is tight

implosion (double) - both use the same telegraph
raidwide

shackled apart - tethers all supports to all dps, make sure to stay apart
	have supports stack north and dps stack south
umbral orbs 4 + fade to shadow - start on squiggly safe spots, assign one light party to move clockwise, one light party to move anticlockwise
	for two out of three patterns, you do light party movements first then 'role' movements - i.e. tanks move towards purple orbs, everyone else towards orange
	if the SQUIGGLY line completely separates the purple and orange orbs (i.e. one half as both purple, one has both orange) then you do role movements FIRST and light party after

raidwide
throne of shadow
pitch bog - use the same spots as last time, this is where it's important
giga slash (quadruple) - all use the same telegraph, dodge the same way
	as soon as the final cleave is over, move into the pitch bog puddle you placed

voidgate amplifier - spawns 8 puddles needing 2 players each, 4 outside on the intercardinals need soaking first, then 4 inside on the cardinals
	need to go into the pitch bog puddles to spawn a shadow clone each that will take a puddle
shadowkeeper - stand slightly outside your tower, on the corner closest to the boss, while facing the boss
	this means your clone will be teleported inside the tower and take it
	two strats for this:
		1 - have ranged + their clones take outside puddles, while melee + their clones take inside puddles
		2 - pair up and bait 2 clones in the outside puddles, then have 2 players in the inside puddles
	strat 2 is generally preferred

shadowy eruption - puddles underneath each player, place these roughly in pitch bog spots
voidgate 3 + shackled together - supports are tethered to dps again but they need to stay close this time
	supports go to their respective colour-coded puddle and dps adjust to whichever support they get tethered to

tankbuster combo
umbral orbs 5 + distant scream - same as 3 but no bogs
raidwide x3
