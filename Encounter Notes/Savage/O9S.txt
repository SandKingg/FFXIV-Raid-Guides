this fight has two 'parts' with a small phase in the middle
which part comes before and after the middle is random

part 1 - water > earth
longitudal/latitudinal implosion - does two sets of ninety-degree cleaves on opposite sides
	longitudinal - front/back cleaved first, then sides
	latitudinal - sides cleaved first, then front/back

tsunami - sides become unsafe and gives everyone a doughnut aoe debuff
	supports go off first, then dps

umbra smash - the boss jumps to the further away point out of north or south, dealing proximity damage
	stay stacked for the doughnuts, then quickly run behind the boss
damning edict - a massive cleave through everything in front of the boss
	stay stacked after for the second doughnuts

chaotic dispersion - a tankbuster with a swap

tsunami

knock down (flares) - marks both healers with flares
	healers should choose who goes north and who goes south, party stacks mid for doughnuts
big bang - causes the area around the flares to explode, everything stack mid to avoid and dodge doughnuts

fiendish orbs (busters) - spawns two orbs at north and south that do tankbuster tethers

earthquake - makes the south half unsafe and gives all supports a heal to full debuff and all dps a beyond death debuff
	there will be a knockback towards south afterwards
implosion - dps need to get hit by BOTH implosions to die, while supports do it correctly

tankbuster
earthquake + knockback

knock down (stacks) - assign support-dps pairs and spread out at north to get knocked back safely
big bang - causes the area around the stacks to explode, dps should stay in to die, supports dodge
fiendish orbs (lines) - dodge the four sets of line aoes

part 2 - fire > wind
damning edict

inferno - makes a safe circle in the middle of the arena and marks everyone with an aoe debuff
	getting hit by a debuff that isn't your own does a big knockback
	supports stay out first, then dps

implosion - DPS STAY OUT AFTER THIS
tankbuster
inferno
knock down (stacks) - place as close to the edge as possible, then dps explode
big bang
fiendish orbs (lines)

cyclone - makes an unsafe circle in the middle of the arena and gives everyone a wind debuff
	supports get headwind - look away from knockbacks
	dps get tailwind - look towards knockbacks
	pull boss towards a consistent corner

umbra smash
damning edict
tankbuster
cyclone
knock down (flares) - healers choose which corner each goes to, remember the knockback too
big bang
fiendish orbs (busters)

intermission
bowels of agony - sets everyone to 1 hp and starts the intermission phase
	supports will get tsunami doughnuts and cyclone headwinds
	dps will get inferno point-blanks and earthquake beyond deaths
	everyone should stand max melee around the crystal at the cardinals in their colour pairs
	supports should be slightly in front of dps to get hit by the aoes and knocked forwards
	supports then move forwards after getting knockback in order to hit each dps once with their doughnut
	everyone then kills the crystal
soul of chaos - big raidwide
