stockpile - gathers scrap to rebuild a part of his body, this first one always reassembles his right arm

scrap bots + power generators - scrap bots will drop down in two quadrants, along with two power generators
	players can pick the generators up and place them down, where they will cast energy discharge, which activates any bots nearby
	bots will tether to the player whose generator activated them, they need to kite them into the glowing lava quadrant where they need to die
	assign two players to pick up the generators and activate the bots in each quadrant

scrap rocks - three players get markers above their heads and will drop scrap rocks onto the arena
	these should be played close to the boss
scrap burst - a big raidwide that kills any player not hiding behind a rock

stockpile

scrapline - a 270-degree cleave in front of the boss, hide behind him
	MT needs to use a cooldown for this, there's not enough time to dodge

scrap bots + power generators - bots will only be in one quadrant this time, but spread out enough that both generators are still needed

acid rain - marks four players with blue markers, then does a point-blank aoe around them
	make sure to spread out to avoid overlap

scrap bomb - a stack marker on a random player

stockpile
scrapline

panzer vor - full-metal faust drops down, dealing proximity damage from its impact point
	OT should immediately pick it up, as it needs to be tanked
		gives a stacking physical vulnerability with its tankbusters
	the lava quadrants will activate much faster during this phase, make sure to tank it in the final one to activate
	if it touches the lava, or the boss successfully stockpiles full-metal faust, it's a wipe

scrap bots + power generator + alarum - three groups of scrap bots, but only one generator
	make sure to take the generator to the largest group of scrap bots
	the alarum drops a puddle that inflicts minimum on anyone who walks into it

scrap rocks + scrap burst
scrap bomb
stockpile - this is guaranteed to reassemble his left arm if not done already, as well as add 1 point towards reassembling the main hull

double scrapline - scrapline evolves into this once the boss has both arms
	normally this is an unavoidable cleave, but if you are afflicted by minimum, it doesn't hit you

scrap bots + power generators + alarum + bombs - the bombs explode in point-blank aoes, make sure to dodge and don't get the alarum destroyed by them

acid rain x2

scrap bots + power generator + alarum + bombs - now there are two lava quadrants at once, be careful not to get the alarum destroyed
