wrath of zeus - raidwide

bewitching flight - the boss grows wings and flies north with lasers from the wings showing the unsafe parts of the floor
	also look for the gun batteries on the west edge and dodge those too
	the wing aoes leave electric lines on the arena that grow and eventually explode

electrifying witch hunt - either all supports or all dps get a spread aoe on them and a forked lightning debuff
	stay out until the forked lightning resolves
	this also spawns more gun batteries on the east that do line aoes, as well as one in the north

witch hunt - the boss gets a closest/furthest marker, and those four players will get more spread aoes on them
	make sure the role that wasn't hit first goes out/in and the rest spread their forked lightnings

narrowing/widening witch hunt - the boss does a sequence of alternating closest/furthest markers then a sequence of alternating doughnuts and point-blanks
	narrowing - doughnut first
	widening - point-blank first
	the closest/furthest two players each time will get spread aoes so use a sequence of roles (e.g. THMR) to make sure everyone gets one spread aoe

raidwide

electrope edge - spawns four electomines in the corners of the arena and shifts it to a 4x4 grid of squares
witchgleam - does three sets of two lightning line aoes, hitting two mines twice and two mines once
symphony fantastique - causes the mines to begin casting spark or spark ii
	the mines that are hit twice explode in a 3x3 square, and the ones hit once explode in a 1x1 square
sidewise spark - does a half-room cleave towards the side the boss is indicating, with either four or eight orbs orbiting her
	four orbs means pair stacks and eight orbs means spreads
	go towards the 1x1 mine on the safe side from the half-room cleave

wicked jolt - two line aoe tankbusters that leave a vuln, swap after the first hit

electrope edge + witchgleam 2 - shifts the arena into a 5x5 grid and gives everyone either a 20 or 40 second debuff, then does four sets of four line aoes towards players
	stay in clock spots to avoid overlapping aoes
	players hit three times will explode in a 5x5 square, those hit twice will explode in a 3x3 square
	long debuffs will only get hit once or twice, but will charge up one more later
lightning cage - does aoes on certain tiles, making them unsafe
	first, the short debuff players need to go out and explode
	there are two safe spots in two adjacent corners for the 5x5 aoes
	the 3x3 aoes go in the 2x2 safe spots, away from the 5x5 aoes
	the long debuffs go in a 1x1 safe spot on the edge opposite both safe corners to avoid all aoes
sidewise spark - this will count as another 'hit' for the long debuff players
	for pairs, the long debuff players are ALWAYS the ones targeted 
	after this the long debuffs will go out and explode

wicked bolt - a multi-hit stack marker that hits 5 times

ion cluster - gives everyone three stacks of either positron or negatron
	one tank and one healer will get each debuff, and two dps will get each

stampeding thunder - the boss flies north, creating a cannon and blasting five aoes towards where she's aiming
	quickly run to the safe side to avoid the floor disappearing

electron stream x3 - does three blasts from her cannon, with each giving some debuffs
	her cannon has a positive and negative end, players need to get hit by the opposite blasts to their debuff
	these blasts are wild charges so make sure tanks are closest to the boss
	debuffs -
		four players get point-blank or doughnut aoes
		two players get a near bait (blue arrow) or far bait (green arrow), these are thin cone aoes
		two players need to get hit by one of these attacks
		have the aoes position close to the boss near the corners of the middle tile
		then the bait and 'get hit' players stay near the middle of those two tiles to take the cone baits

tankbusters

electrope transplant - begins a long transition with a series of aoes
	dodge the cone aoes on the ground that rotate for 7 hits
	on the fifth hit all supports or all dps will get spread aoes, so stay spread
	on the sixth hit will be pair stacks, make sure the role who did NOT get the spreads is in front
	then dodge the seventh hit
	this repeats for another 7 hits, with the opposite role getting the spreads on the fifth hit
	finally stay in front of her on the hitbox arrow to get knocked onto the next platform

cross tail switch - a series of massive raidwides followed by a carpet of exaflares on the platform
	can tank lb3 the raidwides once the castbar hits 'switch' but make sure to mitigate as well
wicked blaze - two multi-hit light party stacks on the healers, go into the north corners between the exas
	look opposite to see which one is coming towards you and dodge away from that after they begin to move

wicked special - either her sword or her two tentacles are glowing, indicating whether the middle or sides will be hit by aoes

mustard bomb - spawns two tankbuster tethers that leave a transferrable debuff while also doing spread aoes on four random non-tanks
	every hit gives a fire vuln up, so the two players who did not get hit need to take the debuff from the tanks
	the debuffs explode in aoes so go back to being spread after passing them

aetherial conversion - turns her two tentacles either blue or orange
	blue - a knockback from that side
	orange - aoe from that side

tail thrust - executes the abilities of her tentacles
	for knockback, use the small indicators of where the tails land to get knocked to an opposite corner
	for aoes, dodge in the opposite north middle square, towards the corner of it

azure thunder - a raidwide that also creates an electric border, leaving only a circle of the platform safe

twilight sabbath - spawns four clones towards each cardinal
wicked fire - baits large aoe puddles on every player
	two of the sabbath clones will be spawning faster than the others, so dodge their sidewise spark first
wicked special - dodge the second clones cleaves along with this aoe

midnight sabbath - spawns eight sabbath clones towards the cardinals and intercardinals
	one set, either cardinals or intercardinals, will be spawning faster than the rest
	winged clones do doughnut aoes, gun clones do line aoes
concentrated/scattered burst - either a pair stack into spread or spread into pair stack respectively
	if the first set is winged, dodge inside the doughnut, otherwise dodge away from the lines

wicked special

wicked thunder - raidwide

aetherial conversion

flame slash - removes the middle two columns of the platform, spread in light parties to the sides

raining swords - spawns four towers on each platform that need to be soaked, assign a role order to soak each

chain lightning - indicates which swords that lightning will jump to and do point-blank aoes, each side will get four sets of aoes
	the jumps alternate sides each time to give time to move
	if you need to do a 1 -> 4 or 4 -> 1 dodge, use sprint
	each sword will be safe exactly once but each light party gets a different order

tail thrust
mustard bomb
aetherial conversion
azure thunder
ion cluster - only gives one stack of the debuff this time, with either a long or short timer
	tanks will always get opposite debuffs and opposite timers, same with healers

sunrise sabbath - spawns six clones, four on the intercardinals and two on opposite cardinals
	the intercardinal clones will be gun clones, imbued with a specific element, that will fire towards the closest player
	short timers need to quickly bait their gun clone away from others, again opposite of their debuff
	the cardinal clones are winged clones that are looking towards where towers will spawn
	long timers need to take these towers and line aoes need to be baited away from them
wicked special - dodge this aoe before the next set of timers bait
	long timers bait line aoes while short timers now take the towers
	look again where the clones are looking to see towers

tail thrust

sword quiver x3 - the boss carves a set of four line aoes into the platform, followed by very hard-hitting pair cleaves
	if the pattern has a line north or south, safe spots are east, west and then SE/NE and NE/NW, opposite of the horizontal line
	if the pattern has a line through the middle, safe spots are at the intercardinals
