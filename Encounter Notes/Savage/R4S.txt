wrath of zeus - raidwide

bewitching flight - the boss grows wings and flies north with lasers from the wings showing the unsafe parts of the floor
	also look for the gun batteries on the west edge and dodge those too
	the wing aoes leave electric lines on the arena that grow and eventually explode

electrifying witch hunt - either all supports or all dps get a spread aoe on them and a forked lightning debuff
	stay out until the forked lightning resolves
	this also spawns more gun batteries on the east that do line aoes, as well as one in the north

witch hunt - the boss gets a closest/furthest marker, and those four players will get more spread aoes on them
	make sure the role that wasn't hit first goes out/in and the rest spread their forked lightnings

narrowing/widening witch hunt - the boss does a sequence of alternating closest/furthest markers then a sequence of alternating doughnuts and point-blanks
	narrowing - doughnut first
	widening - point-blank first
	the closest/furthest two players each time will get spread aoes so use a sequence of roles (e.g. THMR) to make sure everyone gets one spread aoe

raidwide

electrope edge - spawns four electomines in the corners of the arena and shifts it to a 4x4 grid of squares
witchgleam - does three sets of two lightning line aoes, hitting two mines twice and two mines once
symphony fantastique - causes the mines to begin casting spark or spark ii
	the mines that are hit twice explode in a 3x3 square, and the ones hit once explode in a 1x1 square
sidewise spark - does a half-room cleave towards the side the boss is indicating, with either four or eight orbs orbiting her
	four orbs means pair stacks and eight orbs means spreads
	go towards the 1x1 mine on the safe side from the half-room cleave

wicked jolt - two line aoe tankbusters that leave a vuln, swap after the first hit

electrope edge + witchgleam 2 - shifts the arena into a 5x5 grid and gives everyone either a 20 or 40 second debuff, then does four sets of four line aoes towards players
	stay in clock spots to avoid overlapping aoes
	players hit three times will explode in a 5x5 square, those hit twice will explode in a 3x3 square
	long debuffs will only get hit once or twice, but will charge up one more later
lightning cage - does aoes on certain tiles, making them unsafe
	first, the short debuff players need to go out and explode
	there are two safe spots in two adjacent corners for the 5x5 aoes
	the 3x3 aoes go in the 2x2 safe spots, away from the 5x5 aoes
	the long debuffs go in a 1x1 safe spot on the edge opposite both safe corners to avoid all aoes
sidewise spark - this will count as another 'hit' for the long debuff players
	for pairs, the long debuff players are ALWAYS the ones targeted 
	after this the long debuffs will go out and explode

wicked bolt - a multi-hit stack marker that hits 5 times

ion cluster - gives everyone three stacks of either positron or negatron
	one tank and one healer will get each debuff, and two dps will get each

stampeding thunder - the boss flies north, creating a cannon and blasting five aoes towards where she's aiming
	quickly run to the safe side to avoid the floor disappearing

electron stream x3 - does three blasts from her cannon, with each giving some debuffs
	her cannon has a positive and negative end, players need to get hit by the opposite blasts to their debuff
	these blasts are wild charges so make sure tanks are closest to the boss
	debuffs -
		four players get point-blank or doughnut aoes
		two players get a near bait (blue arrow) or far bait (green arrow), these are thin cone aoes
		two players need to get hit by one of these attacks
		have the aoes position close to the boss near the corners of the middle tile
		then the bait and 'get hit' players stay near the middle of those two tiles to take the cone baits
