bloody caress - an unmarked tankbuster occurs throughout the fight that leaves a vuln up on the MT
	swap at 3 stacks

thorn whip - chains multiple players together with vines that need to be stretched and broken
	stay stacked for this to avoid making unbreakable chains

briary growth - spawns three dark matter bulbs that create expanding briar aoes
	try to keep them on one set side and kill any bulbs on the wrong side
	e.g. keep the left side for briars and right safe, unless impossible

thorn whip

floral trap - marks a random player with a yellow marker, then drags them in and attempts to devour them
	stand in the briars or use kb resist to avoid getting dragged in
	the drag-in is a cone aoe so don't get clipped by someone else
devour - eats any players in melee range and gains a damage up for each player eaten

spit - a raidwide that also releases any devoured players

loops until ~70% hp

blighted bouquet - deals massive damage to anyone moving, casting or attacking
	the snapshot is very strict here, so don't greed

floral trap + devour
spit

viscid emission - a player will be marked with a honey debuff and spawn a dark matter hornet add
	the add needs to be killed quickly or it will cast final sting and kill the honey player
	adds will keep spawning as long as the player has the debuff but this isn't an issue with current levels of damage
		the intended method is to get devoured but this really isn't needed anymore

thorn whip

loops from blighted bouquet until ~40% hp

leafstorm - a big transition raidwide that spawns three dark matter slugs
	the OT should quickly pick them up and players should get one low but not kill it

acid rain - spawns three puddles under random players that leave behind acidic honey adds
	these adds occasionally cast acid cloud which gives everyone a stacking dot
		at 10 stacks you wipe
	have one slug eat all the acidic honey adds to become a super slug
	then kill all the slugs quickly before they cast their massive raidwide and wipe the group

thorn whip

swarm - places 4 stacks of a debuff on the MT that deal high damage, so make sure to swap

thorn whip + rotten stench - places a blue marker on a random player and then does a line stack towards them
	break thorns in a straight line behind the boss so you can stack together
