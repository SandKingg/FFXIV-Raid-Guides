eunomia - raidwide + bleed

dike - two tankbusters on the top 2 in aggro, 1st gets light and 2nd gets dark, these give vulns
	these then hit again, so you need to tank swap during the cast
	if swapping back after, don't provoke until BOTH hits have gone off
	these DO NOT cleave, so tanks can stack

jury overruling - imbues with light or darkness then sends a clone towards every player, doing a line aoe
	assign clock spots to everyone
	light - leaves a small point-blank aoe underneath each player where they were hit
	darkness - leaves a small doughnut aoe underneath each player where they were hit
inevitable law/sentence - based on whether the previous overruling was cast with light or darkness
	light - does inevitable law, a light party stack on each healer
		assign east/west sides for each light party
	darkness - does inevitable sentence, pair stacks on either all dps or all supports
		assign dps or supports to rotate for colour pairs

upheld overruling - different based on light/dark imbue
	light - targets a random player with a tether then jumps to them, doing a big stack
		have the player move to the middle of the hitbox to avoid moving the boss
		at the end, does a big point-blank aoe centred on the boss
	darkness - targets a random tank then jumps to them, doing a massive aoe tankbuster
		have the tank move to the middle of the hitbox to avoid moving the boss while everyone else moves out, pre-position with pairs
		at the end, does a big doughnut aoe centred on the boss
inevitable law/sentence

divisive overruling - imbues with light or darkness, then charges through the arena, doing a big line aoe
	light - the line aoe expands outwards, indicated by lines on the floor
	darkness - the sides that weren't hit by the line aoe get hit this time
inevitable law/sentence

styx (5) - a multi-hit stack marker on a random player, each cast hits for one extra time starting at 5

arcane revelation - imbues with light or darkness, then creates four arcane 'spheres' at north and four at east
	two of each will be light and two will be darkness and will always be in the patterns LDDL and DLLD (though which is where is random)
	whichever element he imbues will be the colour that fires the lasers, so stay away from them
dismissal overruling - imbues with light or darkness, then does a knockback, get knocked into the safe spots from the lasers
	light - does a large point-blank aoe, safe spot is max melee
	darkness - does a large doughnut aoe, safe spot is a bit smaller than the hitbox
inevitable law/sentence

shadowed messengers - creates two clones of themis that cast both versions of divisive overruling, then creates two more clones that cast both versions of upheld overruling
	find a safe spot then immediately dodge into the darkness clone's dash
	MT needs to point the boss towards the light clone, to make dodging the next mechanic easier
	MT SHOULD NOT MOVE UNTIL DIVISIVE OVERRULING IS LOCKED IN
divisive overruling + inevitable law/sentence - this is cast during the break between both sets of clones
	make sure to solve inevitable law/sentence before moving for the second two clones
	for the upheld ruling clones, the tank goes north to the edge of the arena while the other player goes to the middle
	after the stack, everyone runs north into the doughnut aoe and away from the point-blank

jury overruling + inevitable law/sentence
styx (6)

lightstream - spawns three rotating arcane cylinders equally spaced around the arena
	look for the directions they're spinning in and go to the correct safe sixth
	find two adjacant cylinders that are rotating in opposite directions, move between them and go to the section not covered by the third cylinder

raidwide
upheld overruling + inevitable law/sentence

dark and light - tethers all dps to all supports with either a same-element or double-element tether
	each tank and each healer will get different tether types to each other
	same-element tethers need to spread apart, while double-element tethers need to stand close together
	have supports line up more north and dps line up more south
	mechanics where this is in effect are labelled (D&L)

	for kindred strat, these are the markers (essentially yellow/purple are for shorts and red/blue are for longs; letters for supports and numbers for dps)
		A - long tank (potentially tankswap if OT gets long, to keep boss facing north)
		B - short healer
		C - long healer
		D - short tank
		1 - long dps paired with C
		2 - short dps paired with B
		3 - long dps paired with A
		4 - long dps paired with D

arcane revelation 2 (D&L) - imbues with light or darkness, then spawns two light and two dark arcane spheres
	the spheres of the same element he imbued will explode into big point-blank aoes
	stand on a sphere of the opposite element to be safe
	make sure everyone rotates in the same direction to keep tethers correct
	move back to starting positions afterwards

jury overruling + inevitable law/sentence (D&L)
	light - long players sprint and rotate CW to east/west
		short players rotate slightly anticlockwise to east/west
		make sure to move away to dodge the big-point blank from the boss and the smaller ones on the markers
	darkness - long supports rotate CW to 1 and 3 and share with the dps there
		short pairs rotate CW all the way to A and C to share there
		short pairs may need to use sprint here, for supports it may be mandatory to get there in time
	move back to starting positions afterwards

divisive overruling + inevitable law/sentence (D&L)
	light - long players sprint? and rotate CW to east/west
		short players rotate slightly anticlockwise to east/west
	darkness - long supports rotate CW to their partners
		short players just stack with their pair

emissary's will - dispels the dark and light tethers, and kills anyone who did not solve them properly

styx (7)
tankbusters

dark current - spawns three point-blank aoes in a line that rotate in the direction indicated by the circle being drawn on the arena
	the aoes either start north to south or east to west
blinding light - gives every player a spread aoe
	split into light parties, with priority for each side and dodge behind the aoes as they travel around

upheld overruling + inevitable law/sentence
divisive overruling + inevitable law/sentence
raidwide

letter of the law - spawns two clones of themis that cast both versions of upheld ruling
twofold revelation - imbues with light or darkness, then summons the arcane spheres from each version of arcane revelation
	again, whichever element he imbued will be the ones that explode and fire lasers
	the party should stack on one sphere of the opposite colour, while the tethered tank goes to the other and moves a little closer to mid afterwards
heart of judgment - four towers spawn that each require two players to soak
	run across to the doughnut aoe under the tank before going to towers
	take the towers in your colour pairs
	then two more clones spawn that cast both versions of divisive ruling
	find a safe corner, then dodge into the darkness clone's charge
