the scourge of meracydia - twintania spawns with three adds that must be killed immediately
	liquid hell - spawns a fire puddle underneath a player that gives a fiery dot to anyone inside

death sentence - a tankbuster that gives infirmity, causing the target to take less healing meaning a swap is needed
	healers beware there can be an auto attack paired with this which might one-shot a tank even with mitigation

loops until <85% hp

neurolink - drops a neurolink beneath the boss that grants damage reduction against certain abilities but also negates the use of certain actions
	make sure that no neurolink overlaps, or is too close to another one to help with spacing later

fireball - a triangle marker above a person's head that indicates they are being targetted for a stack
	the boss gains a damage up for each player in the stack, so you want to have maximum four players in a stack
	assign lighter parties, while the OT always soaks

tankbuster

conflagration - a blue marker above a person's head indicating they are about to be engulfed in a conflagration
	this also fetters anyone near the marked player, so be careful
	take this directly under the boss and dps focus the add down

fireball - each second hit should run into the conflagration to avoid too many damage ups

loops from first fireball until <55% hp

neurolink - ensure this is dropped away from the first

divebomb x3 - marks a player with a green marker, then charges towards them, dealing damage and a huge knockback to anyone hit
	dealing with this properly is a massive pain, so instead just find the safety hole on the NE-ish and stay in until you hear the sound effect and move out after
	repeat for each of the three divebombs

adds - spawns one asclepius and two hygieiae right next to the safety hole
	hygieia - these explode when killed, inflicting vuln ups to anything nearby
	asclepius - this takes way less damage and needs the vuln ups from the hygieiae to kill

divebomb x3
adds - spawns two hygieiae on the opposite side of the arena, use them to kill the asclepius

aetheric profusion - twintania reappears and does a massive raidwide that kills anyone not in a neurolink
	make sure the MT is in a separate neurolink to the rest of the party as plummet will kill anyone next to them

twister - spawns twisters under random players which explode when anyone get close and do a massive knockback
	keep moving to avoid detonating your own twister prematurely

dreadknight - a dreadknight spawns in the middle of the arena and fixates on a random player, stunning them and walking towards them
	if it reaches its target, they instantly die
	the dreadknight needs to be stunned and killed immediately

tankbuster

loops from twister until <30% hp

neurolink - spawns another neurolink that should be away from the first two
tankbuster

hatch - targets a random player and spawns a black orb that travels towards them, indicated by small orbs around their character
	running into the orb while not inside a neurolink instantly kills you, so the OT should stand in the newest neurolink and soak all orbs

liquid hell - now spawns five puddles in quick succession, make sure to bait them in good places

hatch
liquid hell

loops from tankbuster until enrage
