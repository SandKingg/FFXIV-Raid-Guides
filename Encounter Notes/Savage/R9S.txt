killer voice - raidwide

hardcore - aoe tankbusters on each tank
	these will increase in size if she has 8 or more stacks

vamp stomp - give everyone debuffs, summons bats and does a point-blank aoe that sends out a slow-moving shockwave
	whenever this shockwave hits a bat, it does another point-blank aoe centred on the bat
	whenever this shockwave hits a player, it does a point-blank aoe around them that gives magic vuln
	the two bats in the middle show where the safe spots will be for melee uptime
	MT can insta-cleanse then sprint out to dodge the bats to avoid moving the boss

brutal rain - a multi-hit stack marker

sadistic screech - a raidwide that transforms the platform
	the west and east columns get destroyed and the coffinmaker is summoned, starting the add phase

	coffinfiller + half moon - two of the coffinmaker's saws glow, followed by the other two, indicating which order they will do line aoes
		meanwhile the boss is facing either north or south, indicating a cleave in that direction, followed by a cleave in the opposite direction
		the cleaves increase in size if she has 8 or more stacks
	dead wake - the coffinmaker advances, don't get hit by it

	coffinfiller + half moon 
	dead wake

	coffinfiller + half moon - this time the cleaves are aimed east/west
	coffinfiller + half moon
	enrage
sadistic screech - raidwide that returns the platform to normal

crowd kill - raidwide that grants her 4 more stacks of the buff

finale fatale - raidwide that turns the arena into a circle
	sets of 6 puddles drop down throughout the mini-phase that need to be avoided
	if she has 8+ stacks, there will be 8 puddles, and if she has 12+, there will be 10 puddles
aetherletting - telegraphs rotating cone aoes, then marks one support and one dps at a time for spread aoes
	these spread aoes drop either a plus or x on the ground, indicating how line aoes spread out from it
	if any aoes are placed too close together, they go off instantly
	assign every player a spot between a cardinal and intercardinal where two cones touch
	this is where they place their aoe once it is their time to drop
	then dodge each explosion by staying directly in the centre

insatiable thirst - a raidwide that returns the platform to normal

sadistic screech 2 - once again destroys the west and east columns
	saws will move across and around the arena throughout the mini-phase that need to be avoided
plummet - two tankbuster towers spawn that need to be soaked, along with an aoe that spawns a doornail
	then destroy the fatal flails before they finish their enrage casts
	the doornail does an expanding lightning aoe, so destroy that before it engulfs the entire arena

crowd kill - if you've done the fight perfectly, this will put her to 8 stacks, meaning all abilities have the first empowerment

finale fatale 2 - at a minimum, there will be 8 puddles in each set
hell in a cell - spawns four towers at random cardinals or intercardinals, soaking it spawns a charnel cell that must be destroyed
	there will always be a safe spot of >90 degrees to take the stack cleave later
ultrasonic amp/spread - either a cleave towards a non-celled player (the healer?) that needs to be soaked or a role cleave towards the non-celled players
	the tank cleave is much wider so they need to be in the big safe spot
ultrasonic spread/amp - opposite of the previous
hell in a cell - the four towers always spawn in the four spots that did not have towers last time
ultrasonic amp/spread
ultrasonic spread/amp - opposite of the previous

undead deathmatch - spawns two stack towers, either north/south or east/west
	split into light parties to take the towers
	each tower spawns a bat when soaked that chains to every player in the tower, make sure you don't move too far from the bat otherwise you take damage and get a damage down
sanguine scratch - a series of five sets of eight cone aoes that rotate around the arena
	the first set is aimed between the cardinals and intercardinals, then the second set is aimed on them, and repeat from there
	stay close to your bat as you dodge
	after all five, one bat will have a point-blank aoe and one will have a doughnut
sanguine scratch - the bats can go back the other way
