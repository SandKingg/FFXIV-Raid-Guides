ground-razing particle beam - raidwide

the art of darkness - either the cloud or her two tentacles will be glowing
	cloud - a line aoe on every player, assign clock spots
	tentacles - a pair stack on all supports or all dps, use colour pairs

the art of darkness - opposite of the previous

devouring dark - a small hit on the MT that gives magic vuln, followed by a massive tankbuster line aoe
	have the OT provoke for the hit, then provoke back after the vuln wears off

obscure woods - a raidwide and stage transition

flood of obscurity - a knockback that spawns brambles on every player shortly after
	place them in intercardinals in colour pairs, use marker spots

rejuvenating balm - the boss tethers to either north/south or east/west and does two massive aoes from those directions
	at the same time players will be tethered to the closest bramble, while also supports and dps get tethered
	assign a priority for safe spots from the aoes, there is enough time to break tethers even if you are close to the safe spot

anti-air/wide-angle phaser unlimited - the boss moves to the side of the arena she tethered to, then does a three hit combo based on the cast name
	anti-air - point-blank aoe, followed by massive aoe tankbusters and two light-er party stacks, then a large cone aoe
	wide-angle - a large cone aoe, followed by line aoe tankbusters and light-er party stacks, then a point-blank aoe

raidwide

	the single tentacle will do a half-room cleave on that side, followed by either clock spots or pair stacks

wide-angle/anti-air phaser unlimited - opposite of the previous
tankbuster

empty plane - a raidwide and stage transition

flood of emptiness - a raidwide that also destroys some of the tiles, leaving 12 in a rough diamond pattern
	also gives everyone a debuff that causes them to shoot a line aoe in the direction they're facing once it expires
	the tiles will now activate, disappearing either if two players stand on a tile, or if one player stands on a tile for too long

hypercharged condensation - spawns four hypercharged cloud adds, one at each cardinal, that move towards the boss, giving her a damage up stack if they reach her
	the clouds are heavied by players walking into them and should be killed quickly

full-perimeter particle beam - a doughnut aoe, move into the inner tiles to dodge

the art of darkness - always a half-room cleave, ensure that you wait for players in front of you to move into their tiles before moving
	the cast is very long, giving you time to adjust quickly
the art of darkness - either pairs or clock spots, for pairs take them between two tiles, not on the same tile

deluge of darkness - a raidwide and stage transition back to the first platform

summon - summons two clones that will copy her next attack

the art of darkness - always a half room cleave, dodge the cleaves from the clones too
