earthquake - ground aoe, need to levitate to avoid

gravity - spawns aoes on the MT and one random player, use these to return to the ground

antilight - spawns a pattern of blue (ground based) orbs and yellow (floating) orbs, dodge the respective colour
	the first pattern has a safe spot on the ground in the centre of the arena

gravitational wave - raidwide

gravitational manipulation - creates a blue (ground based) and yellow (floating) stack marker on a dps and healer
	assign all supports to go up and all dps to go down
	the stacks will REPOSITION YOU if you get one, so make sure to preposition to avoid the ground stack going up
aetherial rift - turns the floor into voidy quicksand, levitate to avoid death

paranormal wave - a slow 3-hit tankbuster that kills if you reach three stacks, swap after the 2nd hit
	these notes will mark when the 2ND HIT OCCURS
evilsphere - tankbuster

maniacal probe - marks each support with a tentacle marker that should be taken to the cardinals
death's gaze - look away
epicenter - channels energy into each tentacle, eventually one will stop charging and become safe
raidwide
gravity - make sure people stay stacked while running to the safe spot so they can be brought down to the ground
main quake - the unsafe tentacles will explode into big aoes

raidwide
gravitational manipulation
paranormal wave
tankbuster

-100 gs - creates safe zones in the north and south and marks players with spread aoes, don't overlap
	melees north, ranged south and try to have aoes at the sides of the safe spots
death's gaze
gravity

antilight 2 - go to the centre safe spot, supports will get unstable gravity debuffs meaning they explode later
raidwide
the long drop - a stack marker on a random dps
	will knockback any floating players affected by unstable gravity
	supports need to levitate and get knocked towards their cardinal spot
