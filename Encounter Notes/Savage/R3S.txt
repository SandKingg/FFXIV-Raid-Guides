brutal impact - a multi-hit raidwide

knuckle sandwich - a multi-hit double-stack tankbuster

quadruple/octuple lariat - either a point-blank or a doughnut aoe followed by either cones all all dps or all supports, or cones on every player
	assign clock spots and pair stacks for this
	if his arms are glowing, then it's a doughnut, otherwise it's a point-blank
		this one will always be out

quadroboom/octoboom dive - the boss turns to a random cardinal, jumping towards it and either doing proximity damage or a knockback
	this is followed by either pair stacks (on supports/dps) or spread aoes on every player respectively
	if his arms are glowing, it's a knockback, otherwise it's proximity damage
		this one will always be proximity

raidwides

barbarous barrage - spawns six knockback towers, with three north and three south, followed by a seventh in mid
	first take the middle two towers with four players in each, then get knocked to the corner towers with two players in each
		can also knockback resist and run to the corners on the same side
	then everyone takes the middle knockback tower, requiring eight people
murderous mist - a big 270-degree cleave in front of the boss
	make sure to get knocked into the corner the boss is standing in to dodge this

doping draught - boss rps a bit and gains a buff, changing some of his abilities
	the raidwides and tankbuster stacks hit twice more now

quadruple/octuple lariat - opposite of previous
quadroboom/octoboom dive - opposite of previous
raidwides
tankbuster

tag team - summons two clones on adjacent edges of the arena
chain deathmatch - the clones will chain to players, indicating that you must get hit by an attack from them
lariat combo - the clones hold up their arms, indicating which side will be unsafe, bear in mind directly in front of them is also unsafe
	this means you only need to look at the one you are NOT chained to, to find the safe area - just stand in front of the other one
	however, you need to dodge the follow-up lariat, run to the safe corner

quadruple/octuple lariat
raidwides

final fusedown - creates an array of eight bombs around the edge of the arena, with long or short fuses and also gives players long or short fuses
	players and bombs will explode once their fuse runs out
	the four short fuse bombs and four short fuse players explode first, then the long fuses
	the fuses are role based, so either all dps or all supports will get long
	have the long fuses wait mid while the short fuses run to long fuse bombs for their aoes
	then short fuse players run back mid while long fuse players run to the new safe spots

quadroboom/octoboom dive

fusefield - spawns a ring in mid with four long fuses and four short fuses attached, while also giving bombarium debuffs to every player
	one role will have shorter 24-second timers, the other role will have longer 40-second timers
bombarian flame - spawns flames on all the fuses that slowly head towards mid
	walking on a flame will deal raidwide damage, give a short magic vuln and remove that player's bombarium debuff
	short timers should be on short fuses and long timers should be on long fuses

tankbuster
doping draught - gains a 2nd stack of the buff

quadroboom/octoboom bombarian special - a multi-hit raidwide followed by a point-blank aoe, then a doughnut aoe, then a knockback into either pair stacks or spreads

fuses of fury - spawns the short and long fuse bombs from earlier, but no fuses on players this time
tag team + chain deathmatch - this time, all players will get chained to the boss as well as one clone, indicating they need to get hit by murderous mist later
murderous mist - depending on your clone tether and where the boss points the mist, you may need to dodge in a corner position
	be careful to get hit by the correct clone and dodge the other

quadroboom/octoboom dive
raidwides
tankbuster

fuse or foe - gives fuses to players, either short or long
infernal spin - the boss spins around, shooting out big cone aoes in front of him, while propagating circle aoes come from two opposite corners
