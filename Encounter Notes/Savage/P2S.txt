murky depths - raidwide

doubled impact - a double-stack tankbuster

sewage deluge - a big raidwide that will make only three platforms and the drains between them safe
	party should start on the safe platform opposite the unsafe platform

spoken/winged cataract - the head and body will each face different directions, then do a half-room cleave and line aoe respectively
	spoken - the head cleaves in front of it
	winged - the head cleaves behind it
	this can always be dodged on a platform, but don't be too close to the body
	grates on the safe platforms will always be safe

coherence - spawns a tether on a random player that will do a massive proximity aoe, then does a wild charge line stack on a random other player
	have one tank take the tether opposite the party, standing next to the unsafe platform is still fine
	the other tank stands in front of the party to take the first hit of the wild charge
	both tanks need to mitigate the hits
	remember to group back up on the platform opposite the unsafe one afterwards

raidwide

ominous bubbling - eventually does stack markers on both healers, assign light parties for this
shockwave - the boss turns towards a safe platform next to the unsafe one, then leaps there and knocks everyone back
	make sure you get knocked to the safe platform, not the unsafe one
	one light party should move onto the drain to avoid overlapping the stacks afterwards
	can also use kb resist
	group back on the usual platform afterwards

predatory avarice - gives one tank and one dps spread aoe debuffs that knock back anyone hit, and one healer a stack debuff
spoken/winged cataract - dodge as normal, then have the debuffed tank move one way and the debuffed dps move the other way to avoid overlap
	the water will recede after this, making the arena safe again

channeling flow - gives everyone a line aoe knockback, with an arrow pointing in the direction they will be knocked back, such that there are two of each arrow
	getting hit by the opposite direction knockback will reduce the distance you get knocked back
	make a plus shape (minimum safe distance is roughly the edge of the platforms) so each person hits one person of the opposite direction

kampeos harma - four players get blue square markers from 1 to 4 and four players get purple triangle markers from 1 to 4
	the body will charge the blue markers, dealing damage reduced by distance, while the head will hit the purple markers, doing a big aoe
	both hits give physical vuln up, but the body hits are not aoe (its charge is, though)
	have the 1234 markers on cardinals and the purple players go there
	the blue 2 and 4 markes should stay on the platform the boss jumps to, while the blu 1 and 3 markers go opposite
	1 and 2 stay slightly in front, then switch over after the first hit

raidwide

channeling overflow - gives everyone a knockback arrow like before, but some people have longer timers and some have shorter
	shorter timers should position to do the knockbacks across the adjacent edges to the platform opposite the unsafe one
tainted flood x2 - two sets of spread aoes, first targetting the longer timers, then the short
	the long timers getting knocked north/south should go to the north/south safe edge and the east/west ones go to the east/west safe edge
		safe edges being adjacent to the unsafe platform
	after the first set of knockbacks and spreads go off, switch over
	there's also a safe spot right in the corner of the safe platforms, closest to the boss but it is tight

spoken/winged cataract - sprint is very useful here to get to the safe spot in time

predatory avarice + dissociation - the head flies away and cleaves from north to south either on the east side or west side
	stay on the safe side for this
spoken/winged cataract - dodge into the safe corner from the cataract and have the debuff players spread along the north or south edge to avoid hitting the party or each other

dissociation + sewage eruption - three baited puddles under every player, move along the boss in the safe side away from the head

tainted flood - spreads on every player this time

channeling overflow + coherence - tank with the longer timer needs to take the tether, the other long timers use the corner safe spot
	this means it's much easier to group up for the wild charge
