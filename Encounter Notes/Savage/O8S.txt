-- PHASE 1 --
mana charge - casts a fire, ice or thunder ability and stores it for later
	watch the orbs for if it's a troll or not
flagrant fire - displays either a stack or spread marker
	if it's a troll, do the opposite of the marker

hyperdrive - tankbuster

mana release - casts the exact same ability (maintaining whether it was a troll or not) that was charged
thrumming thunder - displays intersecting line aoes
	if it's a troll, stand where two lines intersect

ultima upsurge - raidwide

graven image - pull boss north and stack up to bait 3 sets of puddles
	four random players get orange tethers, they should use knockback resist as soon as the tethers go out
	also two random line aoes hit players
	after the third puddle, players stack in support + dps pairs towards the south, careful not to overlap
		these pairs should be tank+melee and healer+ranged for later
timely teleport - kefka very roughly teleports to the furthest away side of the arena from where he is and unleashes a big cleave through the room

light of judgment - big raidwide

mana charge + thrumming thunder + blizzard blitz - for ice, spawns a point blank or doughnut aoe
	if ice is a troll, stand in the aoe marker

graven image 2 + mana release - the statue leans to one side and charges up a knockback
	the knockback MIGHT zap to the other side, be careful
	after the knockback, dodge the mana release

raidwide
tankbuster

graven image 3 - pull boss north again
	all supports and all dps get tethered to one side of the statue each
	top-left side casts pair-stack puddles, mid-right side casts spread rock aoes
	need to stack in pairs with melee pairs closer to north and ranged pairs closer to south
	once the pair stack puddles go off, supports dodge north/south and dps dodge east/west
	stay spread until the rocks go off then look at the statue
	stay away from the glowing side to dodge the cleave
	repeat the puddle + rock dodges, with tethers being swapped now
aero assault - massive knockback from kefka, go behind if he's far enough north or use knockback resist

light of judgment
mana charge + flagrant fire
raidwide

graven image 4 + mana release + thrumming thunder - dodge the cleave along with the mana release

raidwide
tankbuster

graven image 5 - stack up to bait the puddles and watch the statue's eye
	if it's a purple eye, look away, if it's a gold eye with a question mark, then it's a troll so look at the statue
	again supports and dps get tethered to one side of the statue each
	right side will cast sleep, left side will cast confusion
	tethers to the right side need to stack in mid, tethers to the left side need to go out to their respective intercardinal (or cardinal, depending on strat)
	DO NOT USE SPRINT
timely teleport - there's another gaze mechanic paired with this, be careful

light of judgment
raidwide
mana charge + thrumming thunder + blizzard blitz

graven image 6 + mana release - look away from/at the statue and dodge mana release

raidwide x3
enrage


-- PHASE 2 --
heartless angel - sets hp to 1

ultima - raidwide

hyperdrive - tankbuster + bleed

celestriad - does a thunder plus aoe, an icy point-blank centred on the boss, a stack on a healer and spread aoes on all dps then an icy doughnut centred on the boss
	make sure boss is pulled north to offset the point-blank
	choose one side of the boss for the stack to go to, have 3 dps go the other side and 1 the same side but more north
	stay out a bit first, then go in but don't overlap

raidwide

forsaken - big raidwide and mini-phase starts
	three 2-person towers spawn and each dps gets tethered to a head
	heartless archangel - need to be full health otherwise the normally 2s incurable becomes 12s
	healers take the middle tower, dps take the tower closest to their head
	heal up then dps run into their heads to explode them
	wings of destruction (double) - buster aoes on the closest and furthest players
		MT takes close bait, OT takes far bait
		party stays MAX MELEE to avoid clipping the aoes
	raidwide
	towers + heads + heartless archangel
	light of judgment

trine (small) - spawns three sets of small triangles whose corners explode into aoes in order
wings of destruction (single) - does a big cleave on the side of the boss with the glowing wing

wings of destruction (double)
raidwide

pasts forgotten/futures numbered - both start with an untargeted stack on a random player, stack behind the boss
	past - does a cleave behind kefka, stay where you are
	future - does a cleave in front of kefka, move through

ultimate embrace - double tankbuster stack, but can have one tank invuln which clips the next buster too

tankbuster
raidwide

forsaken 2 - another mini-phase
	two ranged should preposition far away to bait preys on the two furthest away players
	then they run north with their following aoes
	spawns two 2-person towers, tanks take east, healers take west
	starstrafe - spawns baitable puddles under the melee dps
		bait five puddles in total very slowly walking north to avoid putting puddles in the north tower
	past's/future's end - spawns a clone on every support that will turn to face them after a delay
		after towers spread south to place clones
		if past, point clones in, if future point them out
	all things ending - clones will do a cleave in front of/behind them for future and past respectively
	after clones, tanks take the two eastern towers, healers the two western towers and dps the north 4-person tower
	then go mid for the proximity aoe and a stack on dps
	tanks can try and stack for this too but need to stay in their tower
	light of judgment

celestriad - make sure boss is already north
wings of destruction (single)
raidwide

trine (big) + pasts forgotten/futures numbered - go to the side of the big triangle that has no small triangle, or mid if all sides have triangles
	do the stack and potentially move through at the safe spot

wings of destruction (double)
ultimate embrace
tankbuster
raidwide

forsaken 3 - another mini-phase split into 4 segments
	segment 1 - spawns three towers and the first graven statue
		healers take west tower, tanks take east tower, dps take south tower
		knockback resist if you get an orange tether
		raidwide
		ultimate embrace
	
	segment 2 - spawns two towers and the third graven statue
		tethers to the right eye need to stay in towers, tethers to the left eye need to go out to intercardinals
		tanks have east tower priority and healers west
		dps should have e/w priority based on their graven 3 positions
		supports should decide who goes north/south if they need to be out
		raidwide

	segment 3 - forsaken 1 again, solve almost the exact same way
		heartless archangel
		wings of destruction (double)
		dps need to be in the 4-person tower at this point
		raidwide
		turn boss east/west

	segment 4 - spawns the second graven statue
		wings of destruction (single)
		dodge into the correct quadrant to avoid the wings cleave and the statue cleave
		light of judgment

trine (small) + wings of destruction (single)
wings of destruction (double)
trine (big) + pasts forgotten/futures numbered
tankbuster
raidwide x2

forsaken 4 - forsaken 3 again, no changes

raidwide x4 - each one gives the boss a damage up stack
