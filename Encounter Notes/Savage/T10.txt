crackle hiss - an uncast wide cleave on the MT

spike flail - a cone aoe behind him

critical rip - tankbuster

crackle hiss

wild charge - a blue marker appears over a random player's head and the boss charges at them, dealing shared damage with the first person taking more damage than the rest
	ensure that the OT is first in line in the stack
	MT should position themselves carefully to avoid sending the cleave immediately after through the party
	be careful as this knocks back anybody hit, so try not to get knocked into the lightning ring around the arena

crackle hiss

erratic blaster - marks a random player for prey, which deals low damage and applies paralysis at the end
	shield the player so they take no damage from the expirty and they won't be paralysed

spike flail

tankbuster
???

loops until ~85%

electrocharge - the boss goes immune and summons two 'son' adds and two 'daughter' adds, each one with some of imdugud's abilities
	each tank should take one of each add and the party should focus down the daughters first

	son of imdugud - will drop a lingering electric aoe after dying, be careful
		crackle hiss
		spike flail
	daughter of imdugud
		erratic blaster
		spike flail

electric burst - a big raidwide

heat lightning - three random players get small aoes around them that deal damage and leave vulns
	you cannot take any other mechanic with these vulns
	if the OT gets a vuln, MT needs to take the charge

electrocharge 2 - same as before except a third pair of adds spawns on the west side partway through
	ensure that the west side adds are focused down fist

raidwide
heat lightning

cyclonic chaos - a random player gets tethered to the boss and will explode after a short time
	stack up on this player to share the damage, but be careful as it gives vuln up
	so these players cannot take any mechanics happening shortly after
