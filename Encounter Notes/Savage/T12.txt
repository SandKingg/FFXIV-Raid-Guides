bennu - these adds spawn under the boss and need to be tanked away
	their corpses linger after death and must be kept apart

revelation - a tankbuster with a vuln, mitigate and swap

blackfire - spawns a blackfire add on one dps, healer and the OT
	if two blackfires are too close together, they will explode so pre-assign positions for the roles to stack on to drop them
	they also explode if someone walks over them so move out quickly after they spawn
whitefire - the same three players will get an aoe around them that debuffs any blackfires hit by it
	party should quickly kill off the blackfires

loops from bennu until 80%

brand of purgatory - one player gets a brand debuff that can be passed to another player by moving through them
	usually we try to juggle brands with healers

bluefire - a random player is marked with a blue marker and needs to drop a puddle away from the group
	stepping in the puddle gives a debuff that reduces damage and healing, but will be useful later

flames of unforgiveness - deals heavy damage to the player with the brand debuff
	if the original player still has it, they will instantly die to this cast

bennu

redfire - spawns a redfire orb that tethers to a random player and moves towards them, doing massive damage if it hits anyone
	one player needs to run into the bluefire puddle and soak the orb, reducing the damage it deals due to the bluefire debuff

tankbuster

loops from first bluefire until ~52%

flames of rebirth - the boss goes invulnerable and begins casting multiple flames of rebirth
	each raidwide gives the boss a stack of damage up, and the first one also revives all dead bennus
	if they were killed too close, they buff each other and become incredibly hard to kill
	party needs to kill all bennus again
	however after dying once, they get revived but much larger, focus these large bennus
	make sure to keep their corpses apart so they don't buff each other

rebirth - consumes the damage up buffs and becomes targetable again
	from now on any deaths give the boss a damage up stack

brand of purgatory

fountain of fire - spawns a fountain of fire that tethers to the boss, buffing it up ot eight times
	if a player stands in it, they will get damaged and debuffed instead, each hit doing more damage
	tanks can take ~4 stacks, other players can take 2

egi - a phoenix-egi spawns and does a line aoe towards a random player, dashing to the edge
