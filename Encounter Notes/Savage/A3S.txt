protean wave - small baited cone aoes on players, followed by another cone on every player
	assign clock spots to spread for these

sluice - targeted aoes on some players, with baited aoes on other players, spread out

form shift - changes to hand form

fluid strike - an untelegraphed tankbuster that needs to be shared with the party, make sure everyone is stacked

wash away - a big knockback in a random direction, use knockback resistance for the first one and go to clocks

digititis - gives three debuffs to random players that can be transferred for a short time before becoming locked in
	one tank gets vuln up
	one healer gets healing down
	one dps gets damage down
	everyone go in clock spots and dps rotate clockwise, this solves the mechanic no matter what
	two players can transfer their debuffs to each other 'swapping' them, essentially

partybuster x2 - dps with vuln stays out of the stack
wash away

boss splits in two, MT continues tanking living liquid, OT takes liquid limb and tank them on the middle ring
	tankbusters now apply vulns to the tanks, DO NOT get hit

hands of prayer/parting - one hand will either become a fist or an open palm
	the bosses should be separated or brought together respectively
	the timing here is very tight

digititis

equal concentration - one hand steals hp from the other and players must target this healthier hand
hand of pain - if the hands aren't within 4% hp from each other after 25 seconds, this wipes the raid

form shift - changes to tornado form

tornado phase - several waves of adds that need to be killed
	wave 1 - 2 piston lubricants
		drainage - tanks take the orange tethers from players and spread
	wave 2 - 3 gear lubricants
	wave 3 - 2 gear lubricants, 1 piston lubricant
		ferrofluid - marks two pairs of players with magnet markers, either spread (if opposite) or stack (if same) to avoid getting stunned
	wave 4 - 4 gear lubricants
		drainage
	wave 5 - 3 gear lubricants
		ferrofluid
	wave 6 - 4 piston lubricants

form shift - changes back to human form

cascade - a massive raidwide that spawns three water puddles (one slightly offset from the other two)

ferrofluid - everybody gets a marker this time
sluice - try to spread close to your clock spot
protean wave - stay on your spot
sluice
digititis - try to pass debuffs appropriately
cascade - use these as tankswaps now, as the untelegraphed busters still leave vulns

liquid gaol - targets a random healer for a stun that pulls anybody nearby into the grasp of a hand
	the hand will move towards the edge from where it spawns, make sure it doesn't go through a puddle or it gets a massive regen
	the hand can be stunned and heavied so kill it ASAP

digititis
cascade - the puddles spawn liquid rage tornadoes this time
	one casts drainage - just a single tether
	one casts protean wave - just a single one
	one casts throttle - an esunable debuff that one shots if not removed in time

drainage + protean wave + throttle (tornado)
ferrofluid

embolus - a small orb emerges from the throttle tornado, make sure it does not hit the boss or any player
