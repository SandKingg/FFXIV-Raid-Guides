resonance - an untelegraphed shared tank cleave, make sure both tanks are standing in front of the boss

nerve gas x3 - three cleaves in a random order, but will always be:
	1 - a 120-degree cleave in front of the boss
	2 - a 180-degree cleave SE
	3 - a 180-degree cleave SW

resonance
loops from first resonance until <90% hp

barofield - creates an aoe under the boss that heavies, gives vuln and deals high damage
	ensure that nobody ever goes under the boss

seed of the sea + rivers - the middle head and both side heads spit out meteors in a random order
	the middle head indicates seed of the sea - a stack on a random player indicated by a marker above their head
	the side heads indicate seed of the rivers - spread aoes on two random players
	the tanks will never get the stack but can get the spread

resonance

primary head + secondary head - stuns the MT, then casts a large tankbuster on them
	OT needs to swap during the cast and mitigate

resonance
nerve gas x3
resonance
loops from seed of the sea + rivers until <60% hp

add phase - the boss walks to the middle of the arena and summons three nodes
	weapons node (sphere) - does cleaves on the tank, stay away from them, also takes 50% less magical damage and has a damage up
		as this node has more hp than the gravity node, you should have more players attacking it
		weapons and gravity nodes must die at the same time or they merge with the electric node
		repelling cannons - a shared aoe around the node, have most players stack on the weapons node
	gravity node (cube) - takes 50% less physical damage and has guaranteed crits
		only have the tank and one caster attacking this node
		void zone - summons a void zone under players that heavy and deal damage, avoid them
	electric node (egg) - cannot be tanked and rotates anticlockwise around the arena, you need to be in melee range to damage it
		tanks should rotate their adds too to avoid merging them
		forked lightning - places a debuff on a random player that paralyses players around them when it expires
	security nodes (untargetable) - these just fire line aoes

emergency mode - does three aoes around the boss and gains the buffs from the adds
	this means that you need to be in melee range to attack the boss AND ALSO TO APPLY MITIGATIONS

nerve cloud - a big raidwide that has guaranteed critical strike for this first hit only

final phase has two distinct patterns that it randomly selects between after every raidwide
pattern 1
	nanospore jet - tethers four players to the boss, applying a tether debuff to them
		two players get blue tethers and two players get green/red tethers
		players with similar colour tethers need to stack, and also stay far away from the opposite colour tether
			breaking these rules applies vulns and high damage
			also, if one tethered player dies, their partner instantly dies too
		if one tank gets a tether, it will always be the other tank who gets the same colour
			this means we can put tank tether north and other tether south
		if tanks aren't tethered, then tethers need to split east and west

	nerve gas x3 - in this final phase, it's always the front cleave first, but targeted on a random player instead of a tank
		to dodge the cleaves with tethers, you should always dodge towards the closer side
		for the frontal cleave, prioritise clockwise if you get targeted

	resonance

	seed of the sea + rivers - for dodging with tethers, spread just far enoguh apart so as not to overlap spread aoes
		for stacking, if a tethered player gets the stack, the two untethered players go to them
		if an untethered player gets the stack, they choose which side to stack with

	loops once

	raidwide - not a guaranteed crit anymore

	nanospore jet
	resonance
	seed of the sea + rivers
	nerve gas x3
	tankbusters
	resonance

	loops once

	raidwide
