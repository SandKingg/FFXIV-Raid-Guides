-- PHASE 1 --
genesis of flame - raidwide

conceptual tetraflare/octaflare - stores either pair stacks or spreads for later
volcanic torches - spawns four lines that trace out four row or column aoes
	there will always be one safe spot per colour corner that each colour pair should stand in
	depending on the pattern, there will be two 'connected' safe rectangles either north/south or east/west
sunforge - summons either a viper or phoenix that do hot tail or hot wing aoes respectively
	use the lines on the floor to dodge the aoes
	the stored pairs or spreads happens at the same time as the aoes here

flameviper - two line aoe tankbusters that give a bleed and magic vuln
	make sure to double swap and use mits

reforged reflection - one of two mini-phases based on what he transforms into
	you can stay out of his hitbox and use knockback resist to avoid the uncast ability of whatever he transforms into
snake
	snaking kick - a point-blank aoe, stay out of the hitbox

	gorgomanteia - gives one role a 1 debuff and the other role a 2 debuff, indicating which other their other debuffs go off in
		two players in each role have cursed shriek debuffs and two players have poison debuffs
		the cursed shrieks will do a petrifying cone aoe in the direction your character is facing
		the poison debuffs will do an aoe around you

	into the shadows - summons two sets of two gaze markers that turn into gorgon adds
		these adds need to be petrified by the cursed shrieks and then killed by the poison aoes
		they will either spawn all on cardinals or all on intercardinals, but which two are first is completely random
		you need to set up a priority system for who petrifies and who poisons which gorgon
		the role with the 1 debuffs should do the first two gorgons and the other role does the second two
		if the gorgons aren't killed, they cast gorgoneion which is a big raidwide that gives a damage down and kills the add

	ektothermos - raidwide

centaur
	footprint - a massive uncast knockback, either get knocked into a corner from right in the centre or use knockback resist
	
	rearing rampage - four raidwides that each hit two players with a spread aoe that gives a vuln
		stay in clock spots on the edge of his hitbox to avoid overlapping
		remember which of the four sets of two aoes you got hit by for the next mechanic

	stomp dead - jumps to the furthest player four times, doing a pair stack that gives a vuln
		the rearing rampage vulns increase damage taken from this ability so you need to take the baits in order of who got the spreads
		the first pair should move north as soon as the castbar begins
		the second and third pairs should move as soon as he jumps north, with the second pair pre-positioning closer to south
		the fourth pair should move as soon as he jumps south

illusory creation - summons a clone at each cardinal
creation on command - two adjacent clones will get two sunforges, one will get the viper and one will get the phoenix
	spread based on colour pairs into the safe spots at either north/south or east/west
sunforge x2 + manifold flames - does an untelegraphed spread aoe on all supports or all dps that gives a magic vuln
	then does four line aoes on the four closest players that need to be baited by the other role that don't have magic vulns
sunforge x2 + nest of flamevipers/tetraflare - the other two clones will do either two phoenixes or two vipers
	this is paired with either a line aoe on every player or pair stacks
	for two phoenixes, go into the inner square and either stay in clock spots or stack in colour pairs
	for two vipers, go to your colour corner and either stack or spread for the aoes
volcanic torches - summons six lines that trace out three row and three column aoes, making only one corner square safe

raidwide

reforged reflection - does the other mini-phase that wasn't done previously

conceptual tetraflare/octaflare
fourfold fires - spawns four proximity markers towards the intercardinals that explode into fiery vents
	stack mid to mitigate the damage
cthonic vent
