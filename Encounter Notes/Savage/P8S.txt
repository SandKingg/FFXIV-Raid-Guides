-- PHASE 1 --
genesis of flame - raidwide

conceptual tetraflare/octaflare - stores either pair stacks or spreads for later
volcanic torches - spawns four lines that trace out four row or column aoes
	there will always be one safe spot per colour corner that each colour pair should stand in
	depending on the pattern, there will be two 'connected' safe rectangles either north/south or east/west
sunforge - summons either a viper or phoenix that do hot tail or hot wing aoes respectively
	use the lines on the floor to dodge the aoes
	the stored pairs or spreads happens at the same time as the aoes here

flameviper - two line aoe tankbusters that give a bleed and magic vuln
	make sure to double swap and use mits

reforged reflection - one of two mini-phases based on what he transforms into
	you can stay out of his hitbox and use knockback resist to avoid the uncast ability of whatever he transforms into
snake
	snaking kick - a point-blank aoe, stay out of the hitbox

	gorgomanteia - gives one role a 1 debuff and the other role a 2 debuff, indicating which other their other debuffs go off in
		two players in each role have cursed shriek debuffs and two players have poison debuffs
		the eye of the gorgon debuffs will do a petrifying cone aoe in the direction your character is facing
		the blood of the gorgon debuffs will do an aoe around you

	into the shadows - summons two sets of two gaze markers that turn into gorgon adds
		the gaze markers rotate in either direction around the arena before turning into adds
		they will either end up all on cardinals or all on intercardinals, but which two are first is completely random
		if they rotate CW, they end up on cardinals and if they rotate ACW, they end up on intercardinals
		these adds need to be petrified by the cursed shrieks and then killed by the poison aoes
		you need to set up a priority system for who petrifies and who poisons which gorgon
			assign one light party to be clockwise and one to be anticlockwise
			if both players of a given role in a light party have the same debuff, tanks adjust for supports and melees adjust for dps
		the role with the 1 debuffs should do the first two gorgons and the other role does the second two
		if the gorgons aren't killed, they cast gorgoneion which is a big raidwide that gives a damage down and kills the add

	ektothermos - raidwide

centaur
	footprint - a massive uncast knockback, either get knocked into a corner from right in the centre or use knockback resist
	
	rearing rampage - four raidwides that each hit two players with a spread aoe that gives a vuln
		stay in clock spots on the edge of his hitbox to avoid overlapping
		remember which of the four sets of two aoes you got hit by for the next mechanic

	stomp dead - jumps to the furthest player four times, doing a pair stack that gives a vuln
		the rearing rampage vulns increase damage taken from this ability so you need to take the baits in order of who got the spreads
		the first pair should pre-position NE and the second pair directly under the boss
		the other two pairs preposition to the east
		the third pair swaps with the first and fourth with the second after they've been hit

illusory creation - summons a clone at each cardinal
creation on command - two adjacent clones will get two sunforges, one will get the viper and one will get the phoenix
	spread based on colour pairs into the safe spots at either north/south or east/west
sunforge x2 + manifold flames - does an untelegraphed spread aoe on all supports or all dps that gives a magic vuln
	then does four line aoes on the four closest players that need to be baited by the other role that don't have magic vulns
sunforge x2 + nest of flamevipers/tetraflare - the other two clones will do either two phoenixes or two vipers
	this is paired with either a line aoe on every player or pair stacks
	for two phoenixes, go into the inner square and either stay in clock spots or stack in colour pairs
	for two vipers, go to your colour corner and either stack or spread for the aoes
volcanic torches - summons six lines that trace out three row and three column aoes, making only one corner square safe

raidwide

reforged reflection - does the other mini-phase that wasn't done previously

conceptual tetraflare/octaflare
fourfold fires - spawns four proximity markers towards the intercardinals that explode into fiery vents
	stack mid to mitigate the damage
cthonic vent - one vent on the east and west will bubble more, indicating that it will explode
	as light parties, move towards the vent that is not bubbling on your side
	watch which vents the vipers go into as those will explode next
tetraflare/octaflare - move towards the safe two vents and either spread or do pair stacks
	for pairs it's helpful if melee/tanks pair and ranged/healers pair
sunforge - go to the next two safe vents and listen for which animal the boss has
	after the vents explode, move into position for pairs or spreads while dodging the sunforge

tankbusters

reforged reflection 2 - another one of two mini phases, building on the first two
	they always occur in the same order as the first two
snake 2
	snaking kick

	gorgomanteia 2 - gives each role a blood and eye of the gorgon debuff, as well as a crown of the gorgon debuff and breath of the gorgon debuff to two players
		one role will have their gazes go off first, followed by the poison aoes, the other role has the order swapped
		crown of the gorgon is a cursed shriek 360-degree petrify aoe
		breath of the gorgon is a poison stack aoe

	into the shadows 2 - summons four snakes at once that do gazes
		again, if they rotate CW, they end up on cardinals and if they rotate ACW, they end up on intercardinals
		start in colour pairs on the spots the snakes don't end up at
		the role with the first gazes moves to petrify the snakes while the other role's spread aoes go off
	gorgospit - four clones appear that each do a line aoe that makes only the middle 4 tiles safe
		players should quickly swap in their colour pairs to re-petrify the snakes while avoiding the second set of spreads
	illusory creation + gorgospit - creates another clone that will shoot a line aoe, killing two petrified snakes
		the other two snakes are safe for the crown of the gorgon players to hide behind
		everyone else stacks on the other side of the snakes to soak the breath of the gorgon stack, but also killing the snake with its aoe
		use the same priority system for this as before, with melees and tanks adjusting if the crown or breath of the gorgon debuffs are in the same light party

centaur 2
	footprint

	quadrupedal impact/crush - turns towards a random cardinal and either does a massive knockback or point-blank aoe respectively
		move towards where he turned for quadrupedal impact, and away for quadrupedal crush

	conceptual diflare/tetraflare - stores either light party stacks or pair stacks for later
	
	blazing footfalls - telegraphs four aoes in quick succession
		firstly a vertical line knockback followed by either a radial knockback or a giant point-blank from east or west
		then a horizontal line knockback followed by the opposite of the previous aoe, from either north or south
		you want to get knocked towards the knockback and away from the point-blank
		the stacks go off after the first line knockback, so make sure you are already in pairs or light parties
	volcanic torches - three volcanic torches make three columns unsafe
		either use the knockback or run into the correct position depending on the pattern

tankbusters

reforged reflection 2 - does the other mini-phase that wasn't done previously

raidwide
enrage


-- PHASE 2 --
auto attack x2 - this boss's auto attacks are stacks that should be soaked by both tanks
	they become instantly lethal if not soaked by at least one other player

aioniopyr - raidwide + bleed

auto attack x2

tyrant's unholy darkness - tankbusters on the top two in aggro

auto attack x2

natural alignment - gives either two supports or two dps debuffs that do damage over time and wipe the raid if they are hit by certain mechanics
	stack up halfway between north and the middle
twist nature - starts two progress bars on one of the debuffed players that tell you which mechanic is happening first
	the orange bar represents a stack and the purple bar represents a spread
	whichever bar fills faster will happen first
tyrant's flare - baited puddles under every player
	quickly move out to either clock spots for the spread or the middle for the stack
ashing blaze - one side of the boss will glow, indicating that he will do a half-room cleave on that side
	do the second of the two mechanics on the safe side
	make sure not to clip either of the debuffed players with the stack or spreads
end of days - three clones spawn on the west that do line aoes through three rows
	either the first or second row will be safe
	at the same time, the other debuffed player gets their progress bars
	the fire bar represents three pair stacks on the three closest players to them
	the ice bar represents two 3-player stacks on the two closest players to them
	assign specific positions to go to on each row, making sure the debuffed players are not hit by any mechanic
end of days - three more clones spawn on the east, making the other of the two possible safe rows safe
	resolve the second of the two mechanics in the other row
