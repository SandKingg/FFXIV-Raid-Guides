cursed voice - gives one tank, healer and dps each a debuff that causes them to emit a petrifying cone aoe in the direction they are facing when it expires
	don't petrify the boss or her adds as it gives them stacks of damage up

circle of flames - spits a fireball on random ranged players, make sure to stay spread to avoid overlapping them

circle blade - a point-blank aoe

renaud - a cyclops add spawns in the arena, tethering to the first player that damages it and slowly walking towards them
	these can be petrified by the cursed voices, so assign one role (usually healers) to petrify, and a rough spot to kite the add to
	hitting a petrified cyclops with any damage will instantly kill it, so be careful
		however, you want to make sure there is only one petrified renaud at once, as they will become incredibly dangerous once the patrify wears off

loops from first cursed voice until ~80% hp

lamia deathdancer - spawns a deathdancer add that needs to be picked up and focused down, they also cast circle blade
	these adds do untelegraphed cleaves and deal high damage
	having two up at once is likely a wipe

cursed shriek - marks a random non-tank player for cursed shriek which is a massive aoe petrify
	the shriek player needs to hide behind the petrified renaud to avoid petrifying the raid

the boss continues this rotation, adding in a cursed shriek every 2nd? set of cursed voices

lamia fatedealer x4 - at ~60% four lamia fatedealers spawn, one at each cardinal, which should be picked up and focused down
	they cannot move, so dps needs to be careful wheich add they are focusing to avoid getting hit by the cursed shrieks

glowy poison aoes? - at ~60% the arena begins glowing in one of the three segments (inner circle, middle ring, outer ring)
	around 15 seconds later this segment explodes, dealing high damage to anybody inside
	be careful when moving the boss out of the outer ring as there could be a cleave on the MT at that point

lamia prosector - at ~30% hp this add spawns and must be picked up, it deals high damage and casts petrifaction
	petrifaction - a gaze attack that petrifies anybody looking at the boss
		the boss will begin to cast this as well after the add is killed

venomous tail - at ~25% hp the boss begins casting this, putting an esunable poison debuff on a random player

continues looping until enrage
