quadruple crossing - a cone aoe on the closest four players that gives vuln, this then repeats before both of the first two cones recur
	assign four players to be 'in' first, and four players 'out' then switch for the second hit
	remember to dodge the repeat hits after the first two

biscuit maker - tankbuster that gives slashing resist down, make sure to swap

nine lives - buffs the next cast, causing it to be repeated by clones in the future
one-two paw - one claw will glow and then the other, indicated the order that her left and right will get hit by half-room cleaves
soulshade - spawns two clones that will eventually cast the previous mechanic

nine lives + double/quadruple swipe - double is a stack on each healer, while quadruple is a stack on all supports or all dps, assign light parties and colour pairs for this
soulshade - this is delayed until after the next mechanic

leaping quadruple crossing - does quadruple crossing, but she will leap to another location
	ensure that the baits are done correctly around that location
	the soulshade will do double swipe immediately after

bloody scratch - raidwide

mouser - progressively indicates tiles that will be hit by aoes, getting hit by one will crack a tile and two will break it
	eventually there will be a zig-zag pattern of four tiles left, so there will always be a safe spot to dodge near the centre

copycat - summons a clone that will cast elevate and eviscerate, marking a player with a paw marker and doing either an uppercut or a slam
	look at the clone to determine which move she is doing
	a slam needs you to be on a safe platform, an uppercut needs you to be knocked forwards by one tile to a safe platform
	both moves also do a line aoe along tiles in the same row or column, so stay away
	this will happen four times, targeting either all supports or all dps

tankbuster

shockwave - a large radial knockback from the centre of the arena
	the ring is being repaired, but some corners are finished faster than others, ensure you get knocked to a fast-respawning corner
	every player will get a spread aoe after, so stay spread

nine lives + leaping one-two paw - does one-two paw but moves across to another location first, the dash is also copied to the shade
soulshade - this shade is asleep, so the attack will be delayed
nine lives + leaping quadruple crossing
soulshade - also delayed

tempestuous tear/nailchipper - they occur in either order, depending on which clone is activated first
	tempestuous tear - two line stacks on each healer, these need to be soaked while dodging the shade's leaping one-two paw
	nailchipper - marks all supports or all dps for aoes around them, then repeats for the other role
		this is dodged in tandem with the shade's leaping quadruple crossing
		the marked players cannot bait, as their aoes give vulns so quickly adjust if necessary
		the second round of aoes goes off along with dodging the repeated hits

nailchipper/tempestuous tear
raidwide
mouser
copycat - this targets the opposite role to the previous copycat

overshadow/splintering nails - one of the two attacks, will happen twice each
	overshadow -a line stack that cannot hit the player doing copycat, make sure to dodge their lines too
	splintering nails - a cone aoe on a random tank, healer and dps that is not being targeted for copycat
		split into role stacks, but make sure to dodge the line aoes from copycat

overshadow/splintering nails x3
tankbuster
shockwave

raining cats x4 - creates two passable tethers that do cleaves towards their targets, inflicting slashing resist down, while also doing a stack on the closest and furthest players
	rotate through every player taking the tether once, or just have tanks invuln some of the hits
	magic vulns from close far stacks are reducing with how many in the stack? (instead of damage?)

copycat - this copycat will cast predaceous pounce, marking several aoes around the room that will explode in quick succession
one-two paw - try to stay near the middle to dodge this if possible
