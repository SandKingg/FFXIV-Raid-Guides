wave 3 - 3 gordian soldiers, 1 gordian sniper, 1 gordian hardmind, 1 gordian hardhelm
	gordian hardhelm - gives nearby adds a physical vuln down buff, focus these if possible

wave 4 - 2 gordian soldiers, 2 gordian snipers, 1 boomtype magitek gobwalker g-vii
	boomtype magitek gobwalker g-vii - these continuously apply vulns to their target, focus these if possible
		leave at ~15-10% so the gobwalker player can drain them
