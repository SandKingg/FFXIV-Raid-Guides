scorched exaltation - raidwide

heat of condemnation - spawns two tankbuster tethers that need to be taken by the tanks

experimental fireplume - summons either one giant orb or eight smaller orbs from the boss
	giant orb - a massive baited aoe on a random player, ensure that you are all middle to start, then run out
	eight small orbs - shiva circles, run to the first or second explosions to dodge

left/right cinderwing - a half-room cleave on the side indicated by the castbar

darkened fire - spawns darkened fire adds on all support or all dps, split into pairs for this
	if the adds are too close, they tether and wipe the raid
brightened fire - marks every player with an aoe and a number from 1 to 8
	have 1 stack with 5, 2 stack with 6 etc halfway between two fires
	the aoes reduce the stacks on the fires by one, and once all four stacks are gone you can kill them
	make sure to kill all fires before they finish casting darkened blaze

devouring brand - spawns four lines of fire at the cardinals, that slowly move towards the middle before expanding outwards

trail of condemnation - the boss appears at the edge and then dashes through the arena
	if its middle head is glowing, it's a line aoe with spreads on every player
	if its outer heads are glowing, it's a hot wing aoe with pair stacks on all supports or all dps

add phase - spawns four small sunbirds towards the cardinals in mid
	split into light parties and have the tanks take north+east and south+west adds respectively
	kill the adds towards the edge to make sure they don't buff each other upon reviving, then rotate clockwise after killing the first add

	flames of undeath - a massive raidwide that revives the birds and makes them giant
		if any are too close, they buff

	fireglide sweep - each bird tethers to a player, who is then tethered to another player not tethered to a bird (tethers go bird > player > player)
		if tethered to a bird, run directly opposite to the edge
		if not tethered to a bird, run directly opposite the player you're tethered to and be at the edge
		the birds will charge at the player they are tethered to, dealing proximity damage and leaving a vuln
		make sure to move after the birds do their first charge to avoid getting clipped by the second charge
		DAMAGE THE BIRDS DURING THIS PHASE
		once the charges go off, repeat the process you did for the small adds

	flames of undeath

dead rebirth - a big raidwide that wipes if the adds were too close at the end
	the boss also begins auto-attacking the 2nd in aggro from now on

tankbusters

fledgling flight - gives one role sparkfledged markers with an arrow pointing in the direction they will do ashen eye cone aoes
	stand on the markers for brightened fire and point the arrows out, while everyone else stacks mid

experimental gloryplume - does the same markers as experimental fireplume but with an additional ashplume marker at the end
	the first hit will always be shivas
	giant dark fire orb - a stack on one healer and one tank, split into melee and ranged groups with melee having NE priority
	eight small dark fire orbs - a spread aoe on every player

fountain of fire - spawns four sets of two towers, rotating clockwise from either east/west or north/south
	healers should stand in the towers and soak them as they get a massive healing up buff
sun's pinion - marks the two closest players for aoes that drop birds, this happens 3 times
	the birds then mark the player who had their aoe with a proximity tether
	then two players should bait the aoes and place them in front of the towers, then run directly opposite to stretch their bird tether
	usually the order is tank > melee > ranged
	try to stay out of the middle to avoid the bird dashes

firestorms of asphodelos - a big raidwide that spawns three tornadoes at north, SE and SW

flames of asphodelos - does three sets of opposing cone aoes that rotate around the arena, dodge from a safe spot into one that has already gone off
experimental ashplume - does one of the dark fire markers from gloryplume

flames of asphodelos

storms of asphodelos - gives two players tankbuster tethers, then done a cone aoe towards the three closest players to the boss
	additionally, each tornado will be a cone aoe towards the closest player to it
	assign three ranged players to bait tornado cones, and one melee player to bait the boss cone
	the other two cones are baited by tanks using invuln for the busters as well
	if not baiting, stand behind the melee baiter at south

darkblaze twister - empowers the tornadoes, two with fire and one with dark fire
	later on the darkfire tornado will do a knockback and the others will do doughnuts

searing breeze
experimental ashplume - this resolves after the knockback
	make sure melees and ranged get knocked to different tornadoes, then stack or spread as needed
raidwide

death's toll - gives everyone 1, 2 or 4 stacks of a beyond death debuff indicating how many times you need to get hit by the next mechanic

fledgling flight - these should be pointed in to allow players to get hit
	4s should stand in the middle, 1s should stand behind an add, and 2s should stand on an intercardinal to get hit by the further two adds

life's agonies - a massive raidwide that deals more damage the less hp you have?
	since everyone has healing taken down, this is a big heal and mitigation check
