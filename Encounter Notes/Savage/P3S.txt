heat of condemnation - spawns two tankbuster tethers that need to be taken by the tanks

	eight small orbs - shiva circles, run to the first or second explosions to dodge

left/right cinderwing - a half-room cleave on the side indicated by the castbar

darkened fire - spawns darkened fire adds on all support or all dps, split into pairs for this

trail of condemnation - the boss appears at the edge and then dashes through the arena
	if its middle head is glowing, it's a line aoe with spreads on every player
	if its outer heads are glowing, it's a hot wing aoe with pair stacks on all supports or all dps

add phase - spawns four small sunbirds towards the cardinals in mid
	split into light parties and have the tanks take north+east and south+west adds respectively
	kill the adds towards the edge to make sure they don't buff each other upon reviving, then rotate clockwise after killing the first add

	flames of undeath - a massive raidwide that revives the birds and makes them giant
		if any are too close, they buff

	fireglide sweep - each bird tethers to a player, who is then tethered to another player not tethered to a bird (tethers go bird > player > player)
		if tethered to a bird, run directly opposite to the edge
		if not tethered to a bird, run directly opposite the player you're tethered to and be at the edge
		the birds will charge at the player they are tethered to, dealing proximity damage and leaving a vuln
		make sure to move after the birds do their first charge to avoid getting clipped by the second charge
		DAMAGE THE BIRDS DURING THIS PHASE
		once the charges go off, repeat the process you did for the small adds

	flames of undeath
