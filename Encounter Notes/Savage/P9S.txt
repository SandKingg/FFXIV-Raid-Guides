gluttony's augur - raidwide

ravening (mage) - switches forms and does a raidwide

duality of death - two elemental tankbusters on the top 2 in aggro, 1st gets fire and 2nd gets wind, these give vulns
	these then hit again, so you need to tank swap during the cast
	if swapping back after, don't provoke until BOTH hits have gone off

dualspell (fire+ice) - does spread aoes on either all supports or all dps and creates an icy doughnut
	assign clock spots and have one role rotate for colour pairs
	either fire or ice will flash on screen, signalling that they expand
	if fire expands, go out on the second ring on the floor
	if ice expands, go in on the first ring on the floor

dualspell (thunder+ice) - does a line aoe on every player and creates an icy doughnut
	stay in clock spots this time
	if thunder expands, go out on the second ring on the floor
	if ice expands, go in on the first ring on the floor

dualspell (fire+ice) - will expand the opposite of previous
ravening (martialist) - spawns walls on the cardinals or intercardinals

ascendant fist - tankbuster that gives a vuln, make sure to swap

archaic rockbreaker - does a knockback from the centre of the arena, and aoes on all supports or all dps
	stick to colour pairs and get knocked into the walls from ravening
	MT waits until this is being cast before moving to avoid potentially turning the boss
	then look at the lines being drawn, stay near the non-glowing lines either inside or outside based on the combination aoe
front/rear combination - randomly starts with a marked doughnut or point blank then cleaves in front or behind
	then the opposite aoe will happen, so if doughnut first then point-blank and vice versa

archaic demolish - two stack aoes on both healers, split into light parties

raidwide
tankbuster
ravening (chimera) - spawns walls again

levinstrike summoning - summons an orb next to each of the walls
scrambled succession - marks the orbs with odd numbers and four players with even numbers, unmarked players will get blue markers throughout the mechanic
	one boss will alternately kick the orbs into the opposite wall, spawning a tower then rush towards a player, doing a proximity-based fire aoe and hitting anyone in line
	the other boss will leap to each of the four unmarked players, doing a massive ice aoe
	for jp strat, party starts on the first ring, opposite of the 1 & 3 orbs then swaps over once those orbs have been kicked
	fire aoes will be placed behind the party at the edge, ice aoes will be placed right at the opposite edge to the party (these spots swap when party does)
	first ice aoe is marked shortly before the cast completes
	fire aoes are done 2-4-6-8
	towers are soaked 6-8-2-4

two minds - for some reason the name has changed, but this is just dualspell
raidwide
ravening (beast)

charybdis - spawns four tornado aoes either on the cardinals or intercardinals

comet - spawns four proximity markers on the opposite spots to the tornadoes, which drop meteors onto their positions, stack mid
	two will be cracked and two will be uncracked

beastly bile - a light party stack cast on the furthest player, this needs to be baited on one of the cracked meteors
	assign either all dps or all supports to go out first and bait
	assign a way of seeing which meteor to bait on first, e.g. look north then clockwise
	after this hits (after thunderbolt), move out from the aoe it spawns

thunderbolt - aims a cone towards the four closest players which gives lightning vuln
	the opposite role from beastly bile will stand on their colour spots and bait the cones towards the tornadoes
thunderbolt 2 - this needs to be baited by the opposite role, while the others go and bait the uncast beastly bile on the other cracked meteor
	essentially the roles swap over

ecliptic meteor - marks one of the two remaining meteors with a red marker, indicating that's where the ecliptic meteor will drop
	hide behind the other meteor and line of sight the blast
	then run away from the aoe

beastly fury - raidwide

ravening (chimera) - walls spawn again
duality of death
archaic rockbreaker - try to dodge close to where you started and stay in colour pairs for dualspell
dualspell (fire+ice) - dodge the second set of cracks first, then adjust quickly
raidwide

chimeric succession - marks the four furthest away players with 1 to 4 that get massive ice aoes in order
	ideally melees will get the numbers so ranged stay in the hitbox
	MT pulls the boss north while ranged go south
	1 goes to 1, 2 goes to 2 while 3 & 4 wait on the first ring before going to 1 and 2 respectively
	1 and 2 go back to the first ring after exploding
front/rear firestrikes - the boss jumps to the a random unnumbered player, doing a big proximity-based stack on them
	move through if it's rear, or stay a bit if it's front
swinging kick - the boss turns to a random unnumbered player and does a half-room cleave either in front of behind it, based on the firestrikes name
	move to dodge after the cast starts
