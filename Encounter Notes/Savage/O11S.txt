atomic ray - raidwide
	
mustard bomb - tankbuster + bleed

flame thrower - small cone aoes on every player that hit a second time afterwards, clock spots then dodge

larboard/starboard wave cannon x2 - does a ~210 degree cleave on the left (larboard) or right (starboard) of the boss, also turning the boss 180 degrees
	make sure to dodge the second cleave, either stay still or move through the boss
	if it's the same name for both cleaves, you move through, if it's different you stay still

peripheral synthesis - spawns either a blue or yellow fist on every healer and dps, need opposite colour fists to smash into each other
	stand on clock spots to start, ensure we have one healer and 2 dps each side, preferably 1 melee 1 ranged if possible
	dps look at their fist and healer fist, if opposite then they stack on healer (ranged priority) otherwise stack behind the boss
	if all fists on one side are the same colour, one side moves over to the other side
	fists drop electric puddles that give damage up to players
tankbuster

program loop - enters add phase
	executable + ferrofluid - spawns magnet markers on everyone and towers around the arena, 2 close and 2 far
		supports start NE and dps start SW (these are tower priorities)
		magnets that get repelled go to far towers, magnets that get attracted go to close towers
		each tower needs 2 people
	executable 2 - furthest 2 players get a massive tether between them, everyone else needs to soak a tower
		tethered players should stand on the edge of the arena E/W and nobody should move into the tether
		other players look at their debuffs to see which tower they take, shortest debuffs first
		first tower spawns close NW (if executable 1 close towers were N/S) or close SE (if executable 1 close towers were E/W)
		after that, towers spawn clockwise
		meanwhile tethered players need to take outer towers that spawn N/S and E/W alternating
		everyone rotates 90 degrees clockwise after each inner tower is taken
	reset - point blank aoe
	reformat - doughnut aoe
	enrage

delta attack - tank lb3 and heal to full after to avoid petrification

flame thrower + ballistic missile - everyone gets aoes that leave behind fire puddles, need to drop these outside and make sure everyone dodges clockwise
larboard/starboard wave cannon x2

mustard bomb - this also has a tether that the OT needs to take and run to a corner, since it does a massive aoe
	the tether reduces max hp a lot and gives anyone else hit a doom (also gives doom if not taken by anyone)
raidwide

peripheral synthesis 2 - summons 4 big fists on the outside of the arena that will charge through, knocking anybody hit a large distance away
	these target 1 tank, 1 healer and 2 dps, the second set target the other 4 players
	go to the outside of the arena and make sure to keep the middle safe
electric slide - stack up right in the middle to avoid moving omega

peripheral synthesis 2 (2nd set) - make sure to tank swap
larboard/starboard wave cannon x2

update program - enhances abilities
flame thrower (update) - now leaves a dot on everyone
larboard/starboard wave cannon surge - cleaves one side indicated by the name then immediately the opposite side, so quickly move through after the first cleave

pantokrator - a series of mini-mechs to solve
	mrv missile kyrios - constant raidwide damage
	party starts south and baits 4 sets of puddles while rotating clockwise to north
	engage ballistics systems - a line stack
	wave cannon kyrios x2 - four line aoes that target the closest 4 players
		everyone stand clock spots, supports stay in first to bait the first set, then dps go in and supports go out
		dodge puddles while doing baits
	long needle kyrios - a proximity aoe from the middle, take the boss to a consistent corner

mustard bomb - just a tether this time, OT takes it while MT repositions omega in the middle
raidwide

peripheral synthesis 3 - summons a red fist on everyone which need to be slammed into each other
	cheese strat - tank LB3 and stack in the middle
	actual strat - using clock spots from earlier, each pair stack both their fists one by one starting NE/E and going clockwise, ending with NW/N

mustard bomb - just a buster this time
raidwide
flame thrower + ballistic missile
larboard/starboard wave cannon surge

pantokrator 2 - similar to pantokrator 1, with more mechs
	assign one ranged player to bait the large aoe puddles, they start all the way south
	party starts max melee south to bait the first set of puddles, then bait the second set under the boss, then the final set at north
	then start rotating in the same direction as the cone aoes
	stack for engage ballistics systems
	tanks move through the boss immediately and spread out to take the repeated cone busters
	use clock spots to assign 2 sets of 3 other players to bait the line aoes, while the others stay safe
	long needle kyrios

larboard/starboard wave cannon surge x2

charybdis - sets hp to 1

tankbuster + tether
raidwide x3
enrage
