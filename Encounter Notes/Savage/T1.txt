platforms - several of the platforms will glow and, after a few seconds, spawn a dark matter slime for each player standing on them
	these slimes follow whichever player spawned them and will explode if they get too far away
	the boss will eat any slimes that go near it, removing one stack of steel scales and healing based on the slime's hp
	damage the slime to near death, then bring it to the boss
