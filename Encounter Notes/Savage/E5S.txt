judgment volts - raidwide that spawns orbs on the arena
	collecting an orb gives one stack of a buff, but collecting more than 3 turns it into a debuff

stratospear summons - calls down four spears towards the corners of the arena, three being tall and one being small
judgment jolt - causes the spears to explode into point-blank aoes
	the small spear's aoe is much smaller, so move towards that corner

executor summons - summons raiden who tethers to the player with the highest amount of orb stacks
	ensure that the OT have the most stacks, they should have two and nobody else should have more than one
	raiden then flies towards the tethered player, killing them if it reaches them

fury's bolt - empowers ramuh's next ability, causing it to instantly kill anyone without at least one orb stack
	also removes one orb stack from anyone still alive

raidwide (empowered)

shock blast - a tankbuster on the tethered player that also despawns raiden

crippling blow - a tankbuster on the MT

stormcloud summons - marks the four furthest players for stormclouds, and the four closest players for debuffs
	stormclouds will pulse big aoes near them, but if two are too close, they merge and wipe the raid so place them towards the four corners
	the debuffs also occasionally do small aoes, so be careful
	debuffed players need to take one orb stack and move towards one of the stormclouds and get hit once to cleanse their debuff

levinforce - raidwide that also kills? anyone with the debuff from earlier

fury's bolt

tribunal summons (empowered) - summons adds at north and south that charge through the arena
	the north adds will just do line aoes, killing anyone hit
	the south add will do a line aoe that is also a knockback
	this knockback will be increased if the ability is empowered
	stand just behind the solid line near mid for empowered, and behind the dashed line for non-empowered
	this lets you get knocked to the side and dodge the line aoes
	everybody should be knocked to the same side for uptime

tankbuster
raidwide
fury's bolt

thunderstorm (empowered) - causes loads of small aoes to begin spawning on the ground while also marking each role for a spread aoe
	either all supports will spread first, or all dps

executor summons
tankbuster

stepped leader - baits invisible puddles under every player, move away as soon as the castbar finishes
	OT should be careful where they are kiting raiden at this point

shock blast
raidwide

fury's fourteen - empowers the boss with fourteen stacks of the damage up
stratospear summons (empowered) - summons fourteen spears, seven on each side of the middle column
tribunal summons (empowered) - look which side the adds are on, because this side will be unsafe
centaur's charge - ramuh jumps to the opposite end of the middle line from the big add, then charges straight through
	one tank needs to move into the duty action zone, use a big cooldown and the duty action to mitigate the charge and knockback
	everybody else needs to position such that they get knocked through one of the spears on the safe side, disabling its aoe
	duty action tank needs to quickly move onto the safe side to dodge the aoes too

fury's bolt
stepped leader (empowered) - this is now a doughnut aoe, so stay still

chain lightning - givs both healers eight stacks of a chain lightning debuff
	when each stack of the debuff expires, it jumps to the closest player, doing a small aoe around the player it jumps to
	it also renders the first player unable to get another debuff for a few seconds
	pass the debuffs clockwise around your clock spots until every player has had two debuffs
	make sure to not stay too close to avoid dying to the small aoes
	some minor abilities happen during this time
