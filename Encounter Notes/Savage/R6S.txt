mousse mural - raidwide

color riot - two tankbuster hits on the closest and furthest players
	the closest player gets whichever colour gun she's holding up and the furthest gets whichever colour gun she's pointing down
	for subsequent tankbusters, make sure that the tanks alternate who gets each colour
	party should stand exactly on the boss's hitbox to avoid baiting a tankbuster

wingmark - gives every player a wing debuff that will cause them to get launched across the arena in the direction they are facing when it expires

color clash - fires her gun twice or four times, indicating a stack on both healers or all supports/all dps respectively
	this happens later

double style - paints some objects on the arena
	morbol - does a bad breath cleave in the direction it's facing
	succubus - does a massive dark mist point-blank aoe
	bomb - does a smaller burst point-blank aoe
	winged bomb - jumps over to the opposite side, then does a smaller burst point-blank aoe
	the wing debuffs go off before the cleaves, so position to make sure that you get knocked into the safe spot
	resolve color clash immediately after

sticky mousse - two aoes on random players that give debuffs
	the debuffs will explode into stacks once they expire
	split the group into two 4-man stacks to share damage

tankbusters

sugarscape - transforms the arena into a desert, giving everybody a small, permanent dot and giving out debuffs to some players
	one tank and one dps will get shorter timer brulee debuffs, and both healers get longer timer brulee debuffs
		these debuffs do aoes around each player once they expire, so they need to be taken away from the group
	one dps gets a crowd brulee debuff with the same timer as the shorter explosion debuffs
		this is a stack, so everybody not resolving a brulee debuff needs to stack with this player

layer (cactus) - paints a cactus onto the landscape, creating expanding cacti on the arena that explode into large point-blank aoes
	just dodge
	the shorter timer debuffs explode after this

sticky mousse

layer (quicksand) - paints quicksand onto the landscape, creating a large quicksand aoe that pulls anybody caught in it down to their deaths
	more cacti will spawn which need to be dodged, and only the corners will be safe from the quicksand
	the longer timer debuffs will explode here so have both healers run to different corners and the rest of the party run to a third corner

pudding graf - makes the next style spawn on players and do spread aoes around them
	the quicksand aoe also moves north during this
double style - will always be bombs and winged bombs
	players need to position themselves such that the bombs and winged bombs fall or jump into the quicksand respectively

tankbusters

soul sugar - creates several lifeless puddings near the middle of the arena
live painting - imbues each pudding with the soul of a creature, summoning adds: 1 yan, 1 gimme cat, 2 mus
	yan - hatred and malice incarnate, does incredibly powerful attacks and needs to be tanked by the OT
	gimme cat - immediately steals your LB gauge when spawning, so make sure to use it beforehand
		then leaps around the arena
		i crave violence - a point-blank aoe
		hangry hiss - enrage, kill it before this goes off
	mu - needs to be tanked but doesn't do much except autoattack
live painting - summons the next wave: 2 mus, 2 feather rays
	feather ray - tethers to the closest player, casting water iii
		water iii - does a big aoe around the tethered player, giving a short vuln and leaving a persistent puddle
			make sure to put these around the edges to minimise lost space
live painting - summons the next wave: 1 yan, 1 gimme cat, 1 jabberwock
	jabberwock - marks one player when it spawns, rooting them before moving slowly towards them
		kill it before it reaches the rooted player or they will die
		stuns and heavies work, so make sure to use them
ready ore not - a smaller raidwide
live painting - summons the next wave: 1 yan, 1 gimme cat, 2 mus, 2 feather rays, 1 jabberwock
ready ore not

single style - paints a single object, will always be arrows
	arrows - each arrow does a line aoe through the arena, so don't stand in line with them

sugarscape 2 - turns the arena into a riverscape, the river gives fire vuln down and lightning vuln up

double style - can now do fire or lightning styles, this is always paired with arrows
	fire - stacks on each healer, make sure to stand in the river
	lightning - a spread on every player, make sure to not be in the river

layer (thunderstorm) - paints a thunderstorm onto the landscape, making the river deadly and creating a tempest that moves around the arena
	highlightning - a massive point-blank aoe from the tempest, stay away from it

lightning storm x4 - marks two players and creates several small point-blank aoes around the arena
	after a few seconds, the platforms that the marked players are standing on will get electrified
	make sure the players are on different platforms away from the tempest and the party is standing on the bridge between them

pudding party - a multi-hit stack marker

layer (lava) - turns the river into lava and destroys the bridges between platforms
	split up before the cast goes off with the melees on the south platform and two ranged on the north platforms

mousse drip - spawns four towers on the south platform and two towers on the north platforms, then does two multi-hit stacks on the furthest two players
	these stacks leave persistent puddles so take them away from the towers
moussacre - cone aoes on the four closest players, make sure to bait these towards east and west to avoid hitting the ranged players
??? - there are baited lightning puddles next so stay still, then move after the lightning flash on screen
	take towers after this

wingmark - more towers also spawn along with this cast
	there will be four on one of the north platforms and two on the other two platforms
	use the wing debuffs to rotate platforms either clockwise or anticlockwise
