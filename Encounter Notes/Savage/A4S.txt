this fight is split up into four mini 'leg phases' and then a final phase at the end
no real timeline for mechanics, and some come in and out of the rotation as legs die
so mechanics will just be listed out for leg phases, but final phase has more of a timeline
start on right hindleg and go clockwise from there

first leg
	discoid - marks a player with an orb above their heads and causes other orbs to move towards them
		players need to intercept these orbs by running into them
	seed of the sky - dodge aoes
	perpetual ray - one leg will start steaming and needs to be stunned, otherwise this cast does more damage and drains mp
	quarantine - drags the OT and one random player into a side arena where they must kill an add to be released

mortal revolution - big raidwide cast between leg phases, gets more powerful each cast

second leg
	seed of the sky
	perpetual ray
	quarantine
	carnage - marks a player with five tethers, of which three will eventually fire lasers
		intercept the tethers so the player doesn't get blown up by all three lasers

raidwide

third leg
	seed of the sky
	perpetual ray
	carnage
	jagd/straf dolls - summons three jagd dolls at east, south and west and a big straf doll in the centre
		OT picks up the straf doll while dps pick up the jagd dolls
		if the jagd dolls die, they will revive a few seconds later with full hp
		instead they need to be brought low and kited over to the straf doll, where they explode (based on remaining hp) and disappear
		luminous aetheroplasm - a stacking debuff pulsed by the jagd dolls, four stacks is a wipe
		wirbelwind - the straf doll casts this after 30 seconds, removing all of everyone's mp, feed dolls and kill it beforehand

raidwide

fourth leg
	discoid
	seed of the sky
	perpetual ray
	carnage
	jagd/straf dolls
	judgment nisi - gives one player a blue debuff and one player an orange debuff
		these debuffs deal small damage and lose stacks (and potency) over time
		running into another player spreads the debuff to them
		if a player has both debuffs, they immediately die
		the intended strat is to pass these around in a specific manner, but we just let them die out (or keep one colour alive)

raidwide

final phase
	carnage zero - random players explode, so stay spread
	discoid - now empowered with a final big orb at the end that needs to be stacked upon by the party
	seed of the sky
	carnage zero - the stack orb from discoid is taken right after this
	royal pentacle - spawns six coloured adds that are either orange or blue
		the intended strat is to have players with the correct coloured nisi run into the same coloured add to remove it
		however, you can sprint through two with no nisi (or wrong nisi) before dying so three dps can sacrifice to clear each pentacle
	perpetual ray - during royal pentacle, the MT gets spammed with heavy damage, just invuln
	carnage
	jagd/straf dolls
	seed of the sky
	carnage zero

	loop from first carnage zero until enrage
