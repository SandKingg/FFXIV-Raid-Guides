deep cut - two cone aoe tankbusters that also give a bleed
	aggro-based, so make sure OT is second in aggro

flip to a-side/b-side - the next twist will be followed up with either cones on 1 tank, healer & dps or line stacks on each healer
	a-side - go to role positions, tanks in front, healers at the side, dps behind
	b-side - split into light parties, with one north and one south
2/3/4-snap twist & drop the needle - does two, three or four cleaves on the side indicated by the waveform, followed by a final cleave on the opposite side
	then there's a follow up move based on what he flipped to

flip to b-side/a-side - opposite of the previous
2/3/4-snap twist & drop the needle

celebrate good times - raidwide

disco infernal - a raidwide that gives everybody a debuff
	one role will have 23s timers and one will have 31s timers
	it also creates eight moving spotlights that players need to be in at the end of their debuff
	four will be towards the middle and four will be towards the edges

funky floor - creates a checkerboard pattern of ground aoes that alternate every 4 seconds

outside in/inside out - either a doughnut into a point-blank or a point-blank into a doughnut

flip to a-side/b-side - the first role need to be in spotlights during this cast
	four of the spotlights will be in aoes, so make sure you take a safe spotlight
	the melee spotlights were will be the initially SAFE spots, ranged will always be the initially unsafe spots
2/3/4-snap twist & drop the needle - the other role need to be in spotlights before this cast
	again make sure to not go into a spotlight covered by an aoe
	melee spotlights are the initially UNSAFE ones here

raidwide
tankbusters

ensemble assemble - summons eight frogs in the background at north
arcady night fever - does alternating point-blank and doughnut aoes around the boss, along with cone aoes towards specific players
	the cones alternate between hitting dps and then supports
	each player will get one cone, and the next aoe will have a second cone that hits where the previous cone did
	spread into assigned spots then quickly move into someone of the same role to avoid both cones on the next hit
		make sure to move back afterwards
	each hit gives either an alpha or a beta debuff with a specific timer
let's dance! - does half room cleaves in the direction that the frogs in the background are pointing, either left or right
	players need to resolve their alpha and beta debuffs during this
	stack on top of the player with the opposite debuff to you, but the same timer, to share the damage
	failing to stack gives a bleed to both players
let's pose! - stay still and don't attack, to get perfect groove

flip to a-side/b-side

ride the waves! - does aoes on some tiles in each row that move down the arena, make sure to stay in the gaps
quarter/eighth beats - either pair stacks on all supports or dps, or a spread aoe on every player

frogtourage - summons two sets of two frogs on two edges of the arena that dance through, tracing out aoes
	these aoes overlap in such a way that there will be two 2x2 tile safe spots on opposite edges
quarter/eighth beats - either spread or pair stack in the safe spots

disco infernal - this time the debuffs are 9s and 19s
	also spawns four frogs
back-up dance - the four frogs each do a cone aoe towards the closest player, this needs to be baited by the players not taking a spotlight
back-up dance - now the roles swap over, the first spotlights do the baits and vice-versa

flip to a-side/b-side
2/3/4-snap twist & drop the needle
raidwide

ensemble assemble + arcady night encore - the same as arcady night fever, but you don't get the alpha and beta debuffs, just magic vuln
let's dance! remix - this time the frogs can also be pointing forward or back, indicating a cleave in front or behind the boss
let's pose!

frogtourage 2 - spawns two sets of two frogs that cast do the hustle in the order they spawned
	one cardinal will be safe from both cleaves each time
	do the hustle - a half-room cleave on the side indicated by the boss
	back-up dance - four more frogs spawn in the middle, along with two that trace an aoe
		dodge the aoe while baiting the cleaves away
	back-up dance - the same again but the other four players need to bait
	do the hustle - this time both frogs and the boss cleave at the same time, one eighth of the arena will be safe
