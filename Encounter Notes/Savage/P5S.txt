sonic howl - raidwide

ruby glow - does a raidwide and creates an array of ruby cells
	this one creates four square quadrants
topaz stones - summons four topaz stones, with two coated in poison, one poison stone will be close to the corner and one close to mid
	poison stones will do an expanding poison aoe that gives a nasty dot
	topaz stones will cause the quadrant they are in to explode
	the safe spot will either be a quadrant with no stones, or a quadrant with only the poison stone close to mid

venomous mass - an aoe tankbuster that leaves a nasty bleed and a physical vuln up, make sure to tank swap
toxic crunch - a follow-up tankbuster that leaves another nasty bleed

lively bait - spawns two puddles on cardinals near mid and two puddles on intercardinals near the corners
	these puddles have a countdown and spawn an add if not soaked by two people once the countdown ends
		they also do a shared damage aoe on the closest player if not soaked
	assign clock spots, with melees on cardinals and ranged on intercardinals, then have a priority for which pair takes which of the two puddles
	standing in the puddles gives a dot, so try not to stay in them the whole time

tankbusters

ruby glow 2 - this time it makes two larger triangualr segments
topaz stones - spawns one topaz stone and one poison stone between the two segments
double rush - dashes in the direction he's facing, then back through the arena, doing a massive knockback
	stay on the side he's not facing and use knockback resist, you can outrange the damage by standing far enough away
	make sure to dodge the topaz stone exploding its segment after

raidwide

ruby glow 3 - creates four square quadrants again
topaz cluster - spawns four arrays of topaz stones in a set pattern
	the first set are in two opposite quadrants, then the second set are the other two quadrants
	the third set are in three random quadrants leaving one safe, and the fourth set will always make the opposite quadrant safe

tankbusters

venom squall/surge - a series of three abilities in either order
	venom rain - a spread aoe on every player
	venom drops - baited puddles on every player
	venom pool - stacks on both healers
	squall is spread > bait > light parties, surge is light parties > bait > spread

claw to tail/tail to claw - a series of rapid half-room cleaves in front of him and a big half-room cleave behind him in either order
	the cast name tells you which order they come in, make sure to dodge after the first one finishes

devour - a red jaw marker indicates where he will jump to in one of two patterns, but always hitting each corner twice
	the patterns can be rotated or reflected
	pattern 1 - ABADCBCD
		for this pattern, he immediately doubles back after the first jump, dodge C > B > A
	pattern 2 - ABCDCBAD
		for this pattern, he makes an almost complete lap, then doubles back fully, dodge D > A > D > C
lively bait - all four puddles spawn in mid here so we do these in colour pairs
	if all puddles are soaked correctly, the boss will enrage
	instead, the ranged on 1 takes the south puddle and both tanks stand next to the north puddle with a small cd
		alternatively, one tank can stand next to the tower with invuln, preferably PLD/GNB if possible, and the free dps can fill in for puddle mishaps
	the boss will eat the add that's spawned and regain its satiety

raidwide

ruby glow 4 - creates two triangle segments again
topaz stones - one segment will have three stones and one will have two
venom pool - the stones in the segment with two need to be covered with poison, turning them into the expanding aoes
	have one light party assigned to the one nearer to the middle and the other assigned to the one nearer the edge
raging claw/searing ray - either the series of cleave in front of it from earlier, or an aoe that hits the segment the boss jumps to
	either go behind the boss for raging claw, or stay in the opposite segment for searing ray
	if it's raging claw in the segment with poison aoes, the timing is fairly tight to move away from them after the raging claw ends
		the party can stand in the tiny safe spot but the MT needs to move through for the busters

tankbusters

ruby glow 5 - four square quadrants again
topaz stones - puts one stone in each quadrant, with two topaz stones in opposite quadrants and two poison stones in the others
venom squall - assign one light party to start in the east safe spot and one to start in the west safe spot
	wait for the topaz stone aoes to go off, then quickly move into the other quadrant
	then do the spread, bait and light party stack
	for spreads, one person can go right up close to where the aoes intersect, and the rest around the other corners of the quadrant

ruby glow 6 - four square quadrants again
topaz stones - three quadrants have two stones and one quadrant has three stones
venom pool - these need to cover the one quadrant where both stones are towards the edge of the arena, to make sure there is enough space
	have one light party assigned to the stone in the corner and the other light party assigned to the stone near the middle of the edge
