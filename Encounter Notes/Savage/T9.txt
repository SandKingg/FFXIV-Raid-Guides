stardust - a random player is marked for a meteor that drops on their position, dealing proximity damage
	these meteors remain on the arena, but if two meteors are too close, they will explode and wipe the raid

ravensbeak - a tankbuster that leaves a debuff that causes the afflicted tank to explode a few seconds later
	make sure to stay out of the group

raven dive - the boss leaps to a random player
iron chariot - a point-blank aoe
thermionic beam - marks a random player for a stack
raven dive - jumps back to the main tank

stardust

lunar dynamo - a doughnut aoe centred on the boss, that also heals her if you get hit?

meteor stream + dalamud dive - marks four random players for very quick spread aoes
	afterwards, the boss lands on the MT, dealing high damage around them

meteor impact - at ~65% hp, nael jumps to the middle and three random players get meteor markers
	these should be placed in the three inner circles as they also do proximity damage
	three golems spawn, tanks should take the green and blue golems while a dps takes the red golem and everyone focuses it down
	golems will eat nearby meteors, gaining either a damage up stack (red) or haste stack (yellow)
		all meteors must be eaten by the end of the phase, or you wipe
	if a golem eats more than three meteors, or if it eats another golem, it will become supercharged and wipe the raid

	blue golem
		magnetism - pulls in any nearby players, golems and meteors
			be very careful to avoid overfeeding or allowing two golems to merge
		earthshock - an interruptible cast that deals raidwide damage and paralyses
	green golem
		demolish - a big raidwide
		stone skull - a tankbuster
		boulder clap - a dodgeable frontal cleave, move behind it to dodge
	red golem
		earthen heart - drops a lingering puddle that deals damage to anyone inside
		heavy strike - concentric 270-degree cleaves, either dodge between them or stay in the safe quadrant

	the golems will change colours partway through the phase

stardust x6 - six meteor markers spawn on random players in quick succession
	either spread out, or stack and rotate around the arena to avoid placing meteors too close
meteor impact - three more golems drop down that should be handled the exact same as before

megaflare - a massive raidwide that transitions the platform

dalamud dive -  make sure the MT is not stacked with the party

heavensfall - a giant pillar slams down in the middle of the arena, doing a big knockback
	don't get pushed into the death wall
	two quadrants of the arena will then get hit by aoes, so stay in the safe areas

bahamut's claw - two hard hits on the tank

binding coil - debuffs a player with garrotte, which begins increasing in stacks, and kills them at 9 stacks

the ghost of meracydia - spawns an add that should be picked up by the OT
	killing the add does an aoe which drops puddles which cleanse the binding coil debuffs
	binding chain - chains to two players and begins applying stacks of garrotte to them

bahamut's claw

heavensfall - the aoes this time alternate small cones, so dodge between them

supernova - targets two random players and creates puddles underneath them
	stay away from these puddles as they deal damage and heavy anyone who touches them

loops from first heavensfall? until ~45%

dragons - spawns three dragons around the edge of the arena that cast fire tethers, ice debuffs and lightning debuffs
	the fire tether does an aoe that applies a fire debuff to anybody hit
	having both a fire and an ice debuff will remove them both, but having two stacks of either will kill you
	fire tethers should alternate being in and out of the group

bahamut's favor - grants a damage up stack

bahamut's claw - now hits 5 times

fireball - the fire tether on a random player, this first one should be out

thunderstruck - a lightning debuff on a random player that explodes, paralysing everyone at the end
	make sure you stay away with this debuff

raven dive + lunar dynamo - go in after fire tether goes off
	thunderstruck player stays on the opposite side of the doughnut safe spot
fireball - in

divebombs - two players get marked in sequence to be divebombed, going clockwise from north, the first two dragons dive on the first player then the final dragon on the second
	the first marker should run between the first two dragons and the second player runs directly opposite
