-- PHASE 1 --
decollation - raidwide

bloodrake - tethers to one role, storing their aether for later
aetheric chlamys - converts the stored aether to a buff for later
bloodrake - tethers to another role
	if supports they stack north, if dps they stack south
director's belone - gives two supports and two dps a role call debuff while removing the latest stored aether buff
	these debuffs can be passed to another player by running into them, but after you've passed it you can't reclaim it
	this mechanic is 'poisoned' by the aether of the second bloodraked role so they CANNOT end up with the debuffs
	the two players of the opposite role run into the stack and take the debuffs away
inversive chlamys - spawns four tethers and removes the stored aether buff from earlier
	these tethers do big aoes one the cast goes off
	this mechanic is 'poisoned' by the aether of the first bloodraked role so the opposite role needs to take tethers
	the easiest way is to have them stack under the boss and wiggle around to pick up all tethers, then spread out

raidwide

elegant evisceration - a double hit aoe tankbuster that leaves a vuln, make sure to swap during the cast

setting the scene - summons four elemental tiles of water, poison, lightning and fire
	standing in the central part of any tile gives a dot, so be careful
pinax - activates the tiles one by one, causing different effects and dealing massive damage to anyone on that tile
	the first will always be lightning or water
		lightning (levinstrike mekhane) - a proximity aoe from mid
		water (well mekhane) - a knockback from mid
	the second will always be poison or fire
		poison (acid mekhane) - spreads on every player
		fire (lava mekhane) - light party stacks on both healers

north/east/south/westerly shift - the boss wields his cape and sword with one of them glowing
	if the cape is glowing there will be a massive knockback from the indicated cardinal
	if the sword is glowing there will be a massive cleave from the indicated cardinal
	this is paired with the third and fourth pinax tiles
		third is always the opposite of the first
		fourth is always the opposite of the second
	the timeline is third > shift > big delay > fourth

tankbusters
bloodrake - tethers to all eight players, and three of the four tiles
	remember which tile was not tethered
setting the scene

vengeful belone - gives every player an 'acting' role different to their normal role
	supports all get 'acting dps', while two dps get 'acting tank' and two get 'acting healer'
elemental belone - gives every player a debuff causing them to take lethal damage from all three absorbed tiles' aethers
bloodrake - tethers to everyone again
belone bursts - spawns eight orbs around the cardinals and intercardinals that tether to the nearest player
	they take on the role of the player they tether to, being unable to be taken by that role
	each orb needs to be taken by two players and each player can only take two orbs before they get doomed
	players also must take at least one orb of their 'acting' role otherwise they die
	to resolve this, set up clock spots such that there are two opposite colour pairs of dps and two opposite colour pairs of supports
	each colour pair then takes the two orbs of the colour pair clockwise from them

periaktoi - causes all tiles to erupt into an aoe of their element, stand on the one tile that did not get its aether absorbed earlier

bloodrake
belone coils - spawns four towers that can only be taken by supports or only by dps (opposite of icons)
	using the clock spots from earlier, ranged should adjust clockwise and melees should adjust anticlockwise if incorrect
inversive chlamys - the role that is not taking towers should take these tethers and spread them away
aetheric chlamys - stores the remaining aether (whichever role took towers) for later
bloodrake
belone coils
director's belone - whichever role just took towers needs to stack for debuffs
inversive chlamys - whichever role did not take first towers needs to take these tethers

-- PHASE 2 --
searing stream - raidwide

akanthai: act 1 - showcases an array of towers and aoes, then marks each position with a thorn
	aoes spawn on cardinals at the edge and towers spawn at the intercardinals, one closer and one further
	assign melee+ranged pairs for each intercardinal with melees taking closer towers and ranged taking further

raidwide

wreath of thorns - the boss tethers to the thorns, indicating which order they will go off in
	it will be n/s or e/w aoes, towers then e/w or n/s aoes, opposite of the first
	you can maintain uptime by standin gon the small diamonds on the cardinals next to the big mid diamond

nearsight/farsight - aoe tankbusters on the two closest/furthest players respectively
	for nearsight, tanks go in and party stays max melee
	for farsight, tanks go max melee and party all goes in

akanthai: act 2 - showcases more aoes and towers
	this time each cardinal has one aoe and one tower, with towers being slightly anticlockwise and aoes being slightly clockwise

demigod double - a shared tankbuster

wreath of thorns - this time the order is n/s towers + e/w aoes or e/w towers + n/s aoes, then the opposite
	additionally every player will be tethered to one other player, and they will have a coloured marker above their head
	one healer gets a purple (dark) tether to a tank with no marker
	the other healer and tank are tethered with orange (fire)
	two dps get tethered with green (wind) and the others with fire
	everyone gets a thornpricked debuff with a timer, supports have shorter timers than dps
	the tethers will activate their respective mechanics when the players move far enough away, or their debuff timer expires
		dark - raidwide + short magic vuln
		fire - stack
		wind - aoe
	the dark tethered support pair need to move to the aoe thorns on the first tower cardinals and break immediately
dark design - baits a puddle under every player, everyone else except the dark tether pair stacks mid
	after the puddle baits, the dark pair move into the towers, being careful not to get clipped by the aoes
	the fire support pair split up on opposite sides, with one side taking the wind dps pair and the other taking the fire dps pair
	the fire stacks are taken next to the tower, being careful not to overlap
	then, the dark pair rotate anticlockwise towards the other set of towers, one of the fire dps pair also rotates anticlockwise
	everybody else rotates clockwise
	the second set of stacks goes off, followed by the wind aoes after they time out

ultimate impulse - big raidwide

akanthai: act 3 - showcases more towers and a knockback from the centre
	there will be four towers at the edge on east and west, assign one tower for each person

wreath of thorns - the order will be east towers or west towers, then knockback, then west towers or east towers, opposite of the first
kothornos kick - jumps to the furthest player, giving them a vuln and knocking anybody else hit into the death wall
	this needs to be baited by the ranged dps on the side that is not taking first towers, everybody else stays away
kothornos quake - an untelegraphed cone aoe towards the three closest players
	this needs to be baited by the other three players on the side that didn't take first towers
	the towers go off at the same time as this
kothornos kick + kothornos quake - the knockback from mid happens and another kick needs to be baited by the other ranged dps
	then the side that took first towers baits the quake aoes while the other side takes their towers

nearsight/farsight

heart stake - a bleed on the first then second in aggro

akanthai: act 4
