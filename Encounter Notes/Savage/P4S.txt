decollation - raidwide

bloodrake - tethers to one role, storing their aether for later
aetheric chlamys - converts the stored aether to a buff for later
bloodrake - tethers to another role
	if supports they stack north, if dps they stack south
director's belone - gives two supports and two dps a role call debuff while removing the latest stored aether buff
	these debuffs can be passed to another player by running into them, but after you've passed it you can't reclaim it
	this mechanic is 'poisoned' by the aether of the second bloodraked role so they CANNOT end up with the debuffs
	the two players of the opposite role run into the stack and take the debuffs away
inversive chlamys - spawns four tethers and removes the stored aether buff from earlier
	these tethers do big aoes one the cast goes off
	this mechanic is 'poisoned' by the aether of the first bloodraked role so the opposite role needs to take tethers
	the easiest way is to have them stack under the boss and wiggle around to pick up all tethers, then spread out

raidwide

elegant evisceration - a double hit aoe tankbuster that leaves a vuln, make sure to swap during the cast

setting the scene - summons four elemental tiles of water, poison, lightning and fire
	standing in the central part of any tile gives a dot, so be careful
pinax - activates the tiles one by one, causing different effects and dealing massive damage to anyone on that tile
	the first will always be lightning or water
		lightning (levinstrike mekhane) - a proximity aoe from mid
		water (well mekhane) - a knockback from mid
	the second will always be poison or fire
		poison (acid mekhane) - spreads on every player
		fire (lava mekhane) - light party stacks on both healers

north/east/south/westerly shift - the boss wields his cape and sword with one of them glowing
	if the cape is glowing there will be a massive knockback from the indicated cardinal
	if the sword is glowing there will be a massive cleave from the indicated cardinal
	this is paired with the third and fourth pinax tiles
		third is always the opposite of the first
		fourth is always the opposite of the second
	the timeline is third > shift > big delay > fourth

tankbusters
bloodrake - tethers to all eight players, and three of the four tiles
	remember which tile was not tethered
setting the scene

vengeful belone - gives every player an 'acting' role different to their normal role
	supports all get 'acting dps', while two dps get 'acting tank' and two get 'acting healer'
elemental belone - gives every player a debuff causing them to take lethal damage from all three absorbed tiles' aethers
bloodrake - tethers to everyone again
belone bursts - spawns eight orbs around the cardinals and intercardinals that tether to the nearest player
	they take on the role of the player they tether to, being unable to be taken by that role
	each orb needs to be taken by two players and each player can only take two orbs before they get doomed
	players also must take at least one orb of their 'acting' role otherwise they die
	to resolve this, set up clock spots such that there are two opposite colour pairs of dps and two opposite colour pairs of supports
	each colour pair then takes the two orbs of the colour pair clockwise from them

periaktoi - causes all tiles to erupt into an aoe of their element, stand on the one tile that did not get its aether absorbed earlier

bloodrake
belone coils - spawns four towers that can only be taken by supports or only by dps (opposite of icons)
	using the clock spots from earlier, ranged should adjust clockwise and melees should adjust anticlockwise if incorrect
inversive chlamys - the role that is not taking towers should take these tethers and spread them away
aetheric chlamys - stores the remaining aether (whichever role took towers) for later
bloodrake
belone coils
director's belone - whichever role just took towers needs to stack for debuffs
inversive chlamys - whichever role did not take first towers needs to take these tethers
