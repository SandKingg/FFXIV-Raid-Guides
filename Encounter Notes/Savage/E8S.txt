absolute zero - raidwide

mirror, mirror - spawns two green mirrors at north and either east or west, and a red mirror on whichever of east and west isn't a green mirror
	the mirrors will repeat her next attack, but the red mirror will be delayed
biting/driving frost - either a 270-cleave in front or a 90-degree cleave behind
	for biting, go directly opposite the green mirror next to the red mirror, then adjust slightly for the red mirror's explosion
	for driving, go next to the green mirror adjacent to the red mirror, starting between the two green mirrors then adjust slightly to the other side

diamond frost - raidwide that gives one tank and one healer esunable debuffs
	they freeze the players if not esuna-ed in time
frigid stone - one tank, one healer and two dps get spread aoes that will place delayed star-aoes later
	these also inflict heavy on the players with the spreads
	they should be placed on the intercardinals towards mid, use the arena rings and lines as guidance
icicle impact - two sets of aoes spawn around the edge of the arena propagating around the edge, make sure to stay close to avoid getting hit
heavenly strike - a big knockback from the centre of the arena, get knocked into the first aoes to go off
frigid water - the two players who got debuffs earlier will get flare markers that need to get knocked to the opposite sides
	assign a priority for where the tank and healer will get knocked back to
	everyone should get knocked to the same side as the tank except the healer with the flare
frigid eruption - the two dps who did not get a mechanic yet will need to bait aoe circles away from the group

driving/biting frost - opposite of the previous, MT can point the boss such that the centre will always be safe

double slap - a tankbuster that gives a physical vuln, make sure to swap

shining armor - look away as she changes clothes

axe/scythe kick - either a big point-blank aoe or a doughnut aoe

light rampant - a raidwide that gives everyone up to 2 stacks of lightsteeped, chains four players together and tethers the other four players to orbs
	orb players will receive either 1 or 2 stacks of lightsteeped, chain players will receive either 0 or 1 stack
	each chained player is chained to two others and the chains explode if they are too close or too far, though there is a 10 second grace period
	orbs will follow the player they're chained to, exploding if the player touches them
	after a while the orbs shrink and can be soaked, if they are soaked too early then it's a wipe
	if someone reaches 5 stacks of lightsteeped, then it's a wipe
bright hunger - four 1-player towers spawn on the intercardinals in mid
the path of light - shoots cone aoes towards the closest four players
bright hunger - two 2-player towers spawn towards north and south in mid
the path of light
bright hunger - a final 4-player tower spawns directly in mid that must be taken by the four players with only 3 stacks of lightsteeped

mirror, mirror 2 - spawns four green mirrors towards the cardinals or intercardinals
scythe/axe kick - opposite of the previous
	this will be reflected by the mirrors, so go back in mid for axe and towards a mirror for scythe
banish iii - marks either all supports or all dps for stacks, but look at the orbs above her head
	if there's one orb then the stacks are real, so stack in colour pairs
	if there are four orbs, then the stacks are fake and will become spreads, spread into clock spots

shattered world - add phase, make sure one light party stand in each of the circles to be sent to the correct platforms
	heart asunder - a big raidwide between each wave
	wave 1 - 1 earthen aether, 1 aqueous aether, 1 crystalline snowflake
		earthen aether - casts stoneskin that needs to be interrupted, assign players to interrupt each one
		aqueous aether - high hp but can be stunned, slowed, bound etc.
		crystalline snowflake - tethers to the crystal which can be intercepted, but gives light resist down, alternate players each wave
	raidwide
	wave 2 - 2 electric aether, 1 crystalline snowflake
		electric aether - reflectsa flat amount of damage back from each hit, be careful not to blitz them down and kill yourselves
	raidwide
	wave 3 - 1 aqueous aether, 2 electric aether, 1 crystalline snowflake
	raidwide
	wave 4 - 1 earthen aether, 1 crystalline snowflake

akh morn - blasts the top two in enmity with repeated aoes, that give green or blue debuffs
	taking damage from the opposite akh morn instantly kills you, so split into light parties for this
morn afah - a massive hit on the MT that can be shared by the party, make sure to mitigate this

mirror, mirror 3 - spawns a green mirror in north and then a blue and red mirror east or west
	the blue and red mirror are random which of the two sides they are on
hallowed wings - one wing will glow, indicating a half-room cleave on that side which will be replicated by the blue mirror
	this is then replicated by the green mirror
hallowed wings - the red mirror replicates the ORIGINAL cast here, NOT the second one she's telegraphing now
	the safe spots for all three cleaves will be either clockwise from each other or anticlockwise from each other, depending on if the blue mirror is west or east

wyrm's lament
