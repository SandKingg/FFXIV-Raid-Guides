hemitheos's dark iv - raidwide

chelic synergy - a shareable tankbuster cleave on the MT that gives a bleed

aetheric polyominoid - spawns two polyominoids that will do plus-shaped aoes across the tiles in their rows and columns later
	they will always be two columns apart, leaving one column safe on the east and one on the west
	they will always spawn one in the north row and one in the south row, meaning the two middle squares in the safe columns are safe
unholy darkness - stacks on both healers, split into light parties for this
	each light party should take one safe column
exocleaver - does six telegraphed cone aoes, followed by six more untelegraphed cones in the previously-safe spots

pathogenic cells - marks every player with a number from 1 to 8, then does 90-degree cleaves towards them in order
	have 1-4 go to their respective 1-4 markers, with 5 & 6 waiting east and 7 & 8 waiting west
	after being hit, 1 swaps with 5, 2 swaps with 6 etc.
	getting hit twice will kill you, or give an immobilising debuff if it doesn't

aetherial exchange - gives her a buff that causes the next mechanic to swap somehow
exchange of agonies - gives everyone a debuff marker above their head, with two pairs of supports and dps getting theirs swapped
	after the swaps, one role will all have spreads, the other role will have one stack and three doughnuts
	the role with the stack eneds to stay in the middle of the arena, while the other role spreads to their colour corners
choros ixou - two 90-degree cleaves on opposite sides indicated by her hands, followed by the other two spots getting cleaved
	make sure to dodge both cleaves in your spot

synergy - two aoe tankbusters on the top two in aggro that give bleed
	the buster on the MT also gives a short magic vuln, requiring an invuln or a tank swap to avoid dying to the next auto

raidwide

transmission - tethers four players to her snake and four players to her wing, giving each of them a debuff
	the snake players get a glossal parasite and wing players get a chelic parasite
	once the debuff expires, the snake players do a cone aoe in front of them and the wing players to a cone aoe behind them
	since you're stunned, snakes need to face out and wings need to face in

aetherial exchange + polyominoid sigma - spawns two plus polyominoids and two X polyominoids that swap with each other
	the safe tile here is always the middle tile diagonally adjacent to the X polyominoid tethered to the plus polyominoid not in the corner
dark dome - baits aoes under every player, stay out in the safe tile, then move in after the cast ends

aetherial exchange + exchange of agonies 2 - two pairs of support and dps are tethered together, with one having a spread and one having a stack
exocleaver - have the supports go west and dps go east, with the stacks being taken on 2 and 3 and the spreads going into the north corners
	remember to dodge the second set of cones

random tankbuster - will either be synergy or chelic synergy
raidwide

aetherial exchange + polyominoid sigma 2 - the safe spots here are always two diagonally opposite tiles in mid
	look for the X tile that fires through the arena and the tiles it doesn't hit in mid are safe
unholy darkness - assign one light party per safe tile

dark ashes - a spread aoe on every player
choros ixou - spread out near the intercardinal lines to make dodging the cleaves easier

cachexia - gives every player two debuffs, an aetheronecrosis debuff with an 8, 12, 16 or 20 second timer, and a glossal or chelic resistance down debuff
	for the two players with each timer, one has glossal (purple) and the other has chelic (green) resistance down
	the aetheronecrosis debuffs will do large aoes once the timer expires, so spread out
dual predation - the closest player on the east and the west each get an aoe around them
	the east player gets a glossal aoe and the west player gets a chelic aoe
	all players with glossal resist down go west and chelic resist down go east
	the hits are taken in order by the 20s, 8s, 12s and 16s original debuff timers respectively
	each hit gives a new resistance down debuff from its respective colour, essentially swapping you to the other colour once the original debuff wears off
ptera ixou - swap sides from your original side to take the cleave of the opposite colour from your debuff

aetheric polyominoid 2 - places two X polyominoids in two diagonally opposite tiles in mid
dark sphere - gives every player a massive spread aoe
dark dome - baits again, move after the cast finishes

aetherial exchange + exchange of agonies 3 + choros ixou - same as exchange of agonies 1

aetherial exchange + polyominoid sigma 3 - 
	there will be one safe spot north/south and one safe spot east/west
choros ixou - go into whichever safe spot also dodges the first set of cleaves
