stonecrusher - a triple-hit tankbuster that gives a vuln up
	either do a double swap or invuln

weight of the land - makes certain tiles unsafe and gives everyone a yellow pyramid marker
	the yellow pyramids indicate pulse of the land aoes, which mean everyone should spread onto their own tile
	assign everyone to a tile at relative north (looking out of the arena)

evil earth - creates two expanding aoes either from opposite corners or two diagonally opposite mid tiles
	corners are the 'slow' pattern, mid is the 'fast' pattern
	at the same time everyone gets marked with an orange cube for force of the land, which is a stack
	everyone should stack up in the corner perpendicular to two aoes then move diagonally into the mid tile
	on the slow pattern, you move immediately after the 3rd blast
	on the fast pattern you move immediately after the 2nd blast

voice of the land - raidwide

geocrush - titan jumps to a random edge tile (not corner) doing a massive knockback
	make sure you get knocked towards the furthest away corner, or use knockback resist
	at the same time players get either yellow or orange cubes
	1 tank, 1 healer and 1 dps will get yellow and everyone else gets orange
split based on armaments

timeline 1
	earthen gauntlets - titan gets big fists, making only the squares in front of him safe
		yellows will go to the tiles further away in the order titan > dps > tank > healer while oranges stack up
		quickly move out after the initial blast as the squares in front of him explode with aftershocks
	
	raidwide

	landslide - titan turns to a random cardinal and jumps there, doing a T shaped aoe
		the safe spots are the two sets of two further away edge tiles from the cardinal he jumps to
		at the same time, bomb boulders drop down
		make sure to quickly go back to titan to avoid the aftershocks

	leftward/rightward landslide - titan will cleave to his left or right, then aftershocks explode the other safe area
		dodge to one side, then quickly to the other
		make sure you stay on the correct bomb boulders to avoid the explosions

	crumbling down - marks two sets of two players, one support and one dps, that drop boulders with proximity aoes
		the first two should go west and the second two should go east
		place the boulders directly in the middle of each quadrant, very slightly towards the corner
		this means none will be considered too close and crumble
	bomb boulders - three sets of three boulders drop down in vertical lines, that then explode in the order they were dropped
		the centre line will always drop first
	seismic wave - a big aoe from titan that needs to be line-of-sighted
		first go east towards the non-glowing boulder and hide behind it to dodge the wave
		then move into the small safe spots from the centre line, directly south (or north) of the boulder
		then quickly dodge into the centre line once it explodes, be very quick if it's a 2-to-1 dodge

	raidwide
	tankbusters
	geocrush - tanks DO NOT knockback resist this
	
	earthen wheels - titan turns into a car and charges the squares in front of him, knocking players back
		this means the squares on the bigger side of him are safe
		use the same order for yellow cubes and orange cubes stack
		orange tank NEEDS aggro here
		remember to dodge the aftershocks, they propagate one column at a time

	fault line - titan charges the highest in aggro, dealing proximity based damage
		after stacking, the orange tank should move to the 3rd tile in titan's column (counting titan's current tile as the 1st tile), while the party stays away so they don't get run over
		use a cooldown for this

	magnitude 5.0 - a doughnut aoe, along with more yellow markers
		assign clock spots to spread out to after the doughnut
		move one tile away to keep uptime

timeline 2
	earthen wheels
	fault line
	magnitude 5.0
	crumbling down + bomb boulders
	seismic wave
	raidwide
	tankbusters
	geocrush
	earthen gauntlets
	raidwide
	landslide
	leftward/rightward landslide

earthen fury - a big raidwide

earthen fist + weight of the land - titans fists glow in the order that they will punch the sides of the arena
	dodge the fist punches, as well as the unsafe tiles

dual earthen fists - a big knockback circle at north, plus two earthen anguish tankbusters on the top two in aggro and a blue pyramid marker
	tanks should go NE and NW and knockback resist with cooldowns
	everyone else can do the knockback properly
	the blue pyramid is weight of the world, which explodes all adjacent (and diagonal) tiles as well
		it also gives a magic vuln meaning you can't be hit by another one
	that player gets knocked SW into the corner while everyone else gets knocked SE

megalith - a stack tankbuster

tectonic uplift - marks two opposite quadrants that will rise up, while the other two stay down
	dps should go north and supports should go south
	one dps and one support get blue markers, they should fall into the lower platforms and move to the corners while everyone else stays up
	then blue, orange and yellow markers are spread to 1 dps and 1 support each such that everyone has a marker
	the blue markers stay up, making sure to stand in the corners
	the yellow markers fall into the lower quadrant with one weight of the land and spread to different tiles
	the orange markers fall into the lower quadrant with two weights of the land and stack on one tile

raidwide - this also removes the risen platforms

rock throw - marks both healers for gaols, have one go north and one go south

plate fracture x3 - titan rears back one fist, destroying a random quadrant on that side
	ensure that both gaols are placed on the safe side
	for the second plate fracture, it will always target the same north or south as the first, destroying the other quadrant there
	make sure to free this healer first before focusing on the other
	the final plate fracture is random again

raidwide

tumult - a mulit-hit raidwide

dual earthen fists
earthen fist + evil earth - dodge the expanding aoes along with the fists

tectonic uplift 2 - two opposite quadrants rise again, this time with four orange stacks
	split into light parties, with one going up north and one going up south, but stay stacked
	healers are both gaoled again, so place them on your own tile but in melee range of all other tiles
pulse of the land - make sure everyone has an assigned spread tile in the quadrants
weight of the world - either both tanks or both healers get blue markers and should go down into the corners
	then the other role gets blue markers and should stay up in the corners
	all dps get an orange marker and should go into the quadrant with two safe tiles to stack
	avoid the tile aoes too

raidwide
tumult
plate fracture
megalith
plate fracture - will be either adjacent tile to the first one hit, pay attention
	this is paired with a blue marker, 3 yellow markers and 4 orange markers
	the blue marker should go fully south or fully west, whichever is safe
	the orange markers should stack in one of the north safe tiles, while the yellow markers spread in the rest
raidwide

orogenesis - titan reappears, while titan maximum remains in the background

raidwide (big) - now applies a dot as well

weight of the land (rotating) - marks four outer squares and one inner square for explosions which then move clockwise around the arena
	all dps will get yellow markers and all supports will get orange markers
	for this we use the clown face strategy
		position the boss between two middle tiles - this is relative south
		the orange markers go south of that
		the melee yellows stay mid, one with west priority and one with east priority
		the ranged yellows go SE and SW
		switch tiles when the one next to you explodes, then move back

dual earthen fists
raidwide (small) + tumult
raidwide (small) + raidwide (big)
weight of the land (rotating) - this time supports get yellow markers and dps get orange
earthen fist
tankbusters
megalith
raidwide (big)
weight of the land (rotating) - same as the first time
