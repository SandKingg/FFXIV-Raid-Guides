call me honey - raidwide

splash/drop of venom - imbues her next attack with venom
	splash - does a spread aoe on every player
	drop - does pair stacks on either all supports or all dps

honey beeline/tempting twist - one of two abilities, indicated by the moving spear images
	honey beeline - a line aoe through her
		this also drops honey puddles vertically along the east and west edges, so stay near the middle column
	tempting twist - a doughnut aoe
		this drops honey puddles that make the middle area and cardinals unsafe
	do spread or pair stacks after

drop/splash of venom - opposite of the previous
tempting twist/honey beeline - opposite of the previous

killer sting/stinging slash - one of two tankbuster abilities
	killer sting - a double stack tankbuster
	stinging slash - two large cone tankbusters on each tank, don't clip people or each other
		if there is one floor line between you and you're standing on another floor line, that's safe

honey b. live: 1st beat - enters into a mini-phase, doing a raidwide and giving out heart stacks
	reaching four heart stacks heals the boss and gives her damage up
	the starting heart stacks are one of two patterns
		1) everyone gets one heart stack
		2) two players get two heart stacks, four players get one, and two players get none

center/outerstage combo - a series of three aoe patterns to dodge
	a doughnut/point-blank aoe with cones towards either the cardinals or intercardinals
	big line aoes towards the cardinals
	a point-blank/doughnut aoe with cones towards the opposite positions of the first one

love me tender - spawns a random assortment of eleven towers, with each tower giving one heart stack to whoever soaks it
	try to end up with five players on two hearts and three on three

loveseeker - a point-blank aoe that gives a heart stack, don't stand in it
	this also spawns moving sets of hearts to dodge
	getting hit gives you a heart stack, so avoid at all costs

love me tender 2 - this time it creates a stack marker on a random player with the lowest amount of hearts that gives four hearts, split between the players inside
	have all non-three heart players take the stack and get the hearts
	one person will not get hearts if there are five players on two stacks

outer/centerstage combo - opposite of the previous

honey b. finale - a raidwide that resets the stage back to normal

random tankbuster

alarm pheromones - spawns 16 groupbees arouond the edge that do line aoes baited towards random players
	just dodge

honey b. live: 2nd beat - this time four players start with one stack and four with zero, one light party each

spread love/drop of love - imbues her next attack with love
	this spawns heart puddles rather than honey puddles, these give stacks
	spread is spreads, drop is pairs

love me tender 3 - gives two four-heart stack markers to a zero-heart dps and a zero-heart support while also spawning aoes underneath them
	then spawns two heart towers, and two heart aoes on a one-heart dps and one-heart support
	stack players can actually overlap the stacks (weird) while rotating around the boss
	towers will spawn either north/south or east/west and need to be soaked by the non-aoe one-heart players

honey beeline/tempting twist - this is imbued with love from earlier
honey b. finale
splash/drop of venom

alarm pheromones 2 - these line aoes are done in a 'shuriken' pattern, creating a safe spot in mid and four small safe spots around the edges
poison sting - marks two players at a time (one support, one dps) to place aoe puddles that persist and give magic vuln

bee sting - light party stacks on one support and one dps, just stack in roles

random tankbuster
honey beeline/tempting twist

honey b. live: 3rd beat - nobody starts with any heart stacks, instead supports and dps will get debuffs that explode once they expire
	one role gets short timers, the other gets long timers
	these explosions also give one heart stack

spread/drop of love
outer/centerstage combo - heart towers spawn after this and the first set of debuffs explode
	take explosions to the edge to avoid clipping tower soakers
	whichever role is not exploding should soak the towers
center/outerstage combo - same as before, but roles are swapped now
honey beeline/tempting twist - imbued with love from earlier
honey b. finale
random tankbuster

rotten heart - a raidwide that changes the arena again and gives different debuffs
	one light party of players will get alpha debuffs and the other will get beta
	the timers are all different: 8, 24, 40 & 58 seconds
	if two players of opposite debuffs collide, the debuffs are removed and they explode in a big raidwide that gives magic vuln
	timers need to explode with each other in ascending order
	just stay in clock spots and explode mid

raidwide x4 - do the explosions in between each raidwide to avoid wiping from the magic vulns
