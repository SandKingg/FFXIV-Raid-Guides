this fight consists of four phases against four different bosses

blaster
	mind blast - an interruptible cast that confuses everyone if it goes off
	mines - spawns two visible mines (orange) and one hidden mine (blue)
		the off tank should explode the hidden mine, being careful not to get knocked back into other mines
		MT will have magic vulns, so can't take mines
	mirages - spawns mirages on four random players that will turn and charge towards random players
		bait them in a nice line, then move away

	loops from mind blast until 50% hp

	add phase - spawns four small mirages and one big mirage that need to be killed before their casts go off

	mind blast
	mines
	mirages 2 - these mirages tether to random players and either hold their hands up or crouch down
		if they hold their hands up, look away from them
		if they crouch down, look towards them
	
	loops from mind blast after add phase until dead

brawler
	weapon change - equips one of four different weapons and does an attack based on the weapon equipped, weapons will not repeat until all have been seen
		single buster - a big tankbuster
		double buster - a line stack on the MT
		single drill - a proximity-based attack on a random player, move away
		double drill - two big explosions on the closest and furthest players, assign specific people to bait
			usually the MT and a ranged player bait
	chakram - spawns a chakram that slowly rotates around the arena, doing aoes underneath it
	weapon change

	loops from first weapon change until 1 hp

	orb phase - brawler goes immune and runs to the centre of the arena while spawning waves of orbs, also does weapon changes during this
		wave 1 - 2 power plasma alphas, 2 power plasma gammas
			power plasma alpha - need to be killed by the party
			power plasma gamma - need to be soaked by tanks
		wave 2 - 2 power plasma alphas, 2 power plasma betas, 1 power plasma gamma
			power plasma beta - choose one to stun/slow so they stagger their hits as they are big raidwides
		wave 3 - 2 power plasma alphas, 1 power plasma gamma
		wave 4 - 3 power plasma alphas, 1 power plasma gamma

swindler
	height + enumeration - gives everybody height along with one support and one dps enumeration
		height - the platforms are either raised or lowered and each player has high or low vuln
			make sure you stand on the platform type that does not give you vuln
			an easy trick to remember is red debuff = red platform (red is stand on higher platforms which glow red slightly)
		enumeration - will either require 2, 3 or 4 players to stand in the big circle, indicated by the number of orbs
			assign a priority order for supports and dps for who should stand in or not
	bio-arithmeticks - raidwide
	adds 1 - spawns loads of adds that should just be aoed down quickly (or caster LBed) while the MT invulns
	height
	enumeration
	raidwide
	adds 2 - spawns four gunners in the cardinals that should be immediately killed
	height

	loops from height + enumeration until dead

vortexer
	elemental jammer - marks one player for water and one player for thunder
		when they expire, water is a group stack while thunder is a two-person stack
		OT will take first thunder while the rest of the group takes water on C
		the debuffs will pass on to another player on expiry and give vulns to the players they were on
		previous water always takes next thunder while previous thunder just becomes one of the gorup for next water
		water also spawns a tornado on expiry that will tether to people cloe to it and deal massive damage
	fire beam + fire puddles - marks four players for line aoes and spawns a fire puddle under every player
		wait for puddles, then spread before going to spots for lightning+water
	pass debuffs
	ice missiles - two players spawn expanding icy aoes under them
		place these near the tornado so when they expand, they freeze it
		DO NOT GO TOO CLOSE
	pass debuffs
	fire beam + fire puddles - this time at least one player needs to shoot their line aoe through the tornado from the second debuff pass to evaporate it
		wait for puddles before moving
	super cyclone - get knocked to spots for debuff passing
	pass debuffs - they expire after this
	ultra flash - instantly kills any player in line of sight of the boss, hide behind the frozen tornado

	loops from elemental jammer until enrage
