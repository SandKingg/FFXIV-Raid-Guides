spark of life - raidwide & bleed

condensed/dispersed aero ii - big aoe tankbusters that leave a dot
	condensed - a shared buster
	dispersed - two separate busters on the top two in aggro

blades of attis - spawns three sets of two exaflares each around the arena
	one set will always be north, one set will be east/west and the other set will be southwest/southeast respectively
immortal's obol - a proximity aoe from the centre of the platform that also changes the arena into three separate smaller platforms
	go to the northern platform opposite the east/west exas and stay close to the northern exas
	not too close as the aoes are a bit larger than the indicators suggest
	the platforms will link up with a bridge between each of them after this mechanic

forbidden fruit - spawns an io on one of the northern platforms and two stymphalide birds at the edges on the northern platforms
	the ios do point-blank aoes on that platform
	the stymphalides do line aoes in the direction they're facing
hemitheos's holy iii - two stacks on each healer, split into light parties
bough of attis - slams her branches down on the southern platform, doing a massive point-blank aoe
	the safe spots are on the northern platform without the io, have one light party further north and one further south

tankbuster
raidwide

inviolate bonds - gives everyone a spread wind debuff and one support + dps a stack holy debuff
	the debuffs are numbered either i or ii indicating which go off first
	one role will be spreading and the other role will be stacking, then the roles reverse
bough of attis - this time she slams down on the northern platforms and will follow up with a punch from one of the two branches
	take the first set of debuffs in the southern platform with the stack in the centre and the spreads around the edge
	then move into the safe platform and do the same with the second set of debuffs

roots of attis - summons a root that breaks the bridge linking the northern platforms

tankbuster

forbidden fruit 2 - spawns a stymphalide on each platform
multicast - casts two abilities
	hemitheos's aero iv - a big knockback from the southern platform
	hemitheos's holy - a spread aoe on every player
	use the knockback to get knocked into the two northern platforms with one light party on each, then spread in the safe spots from the line aoes
	the bigger safe spots can fit two people in the corners
	you can also use knockback resist and pre-position towards the safe spots

roots of attis - destroys the remaining two bridges
forbidden fruit 3 - spawns an io on each platform
hemitheos's holy iii - the platforms will link with a three-part bridge in the centre during this
	move onto the bridge to take the light party stacks and avoid the point-blank aoes

bough of attis - smashes the northern platforms
tankbuster

forbidden fruit 4 - spawns an io on one of the platforms, two minotaurs on the other two platforms and a final minotaur in the centre
	this io will tether to either all supports or all dps and do line aoes towards them
		these players should spread out along the edge of the io's platform, making sure not to shoot their line aoe towards another platform
	the two platform minotaurs will do proximity tethers to two players not tethered to the io
		these players should move behind the minotaur on the other platform to stretch their tether far enough and not hit anybody else with the cleave
	the centre minotaur will do two baited cleaves towards the two closest players
		the two players with no tether stand on the centre bridge opposite the part leading to the io's platform to bait the cleaves
		then move out of the aoes to avoid getting hit
	getting hit by two of any aoes will kill you as they all give the same vuln

blades of attis - these exaflares are always evenly spaced around the platform at south, NE and NW
multicast 2 - this is hemitheos's aero iv paired with hemitheos's holy iii
	get knocked SE and SW in light parties then move in to the exaflares to dodge

tankbuster

forbidden fruit 5 - spawns four stymphalides and four towers
	the stymphalides always spawn randomly on cardinals or intercardinals (not always all on cardinals or all on intercardinals)
	the towers always spawn offset from the cardinals/intercardinals 
	these stymphalides tether to either all supports or all dps and do line aoes towards them giving a vuln and knocking them back
	either point the line through the middle and make sure not to hit anybody else, or use knockback resist and aim it off the edge next to you
	the role without tethers should take towers, try to have melees take northern towers if possible

raidwide
immortal's obol - the three platforms get linked by the centre bridge again

forbidden fruit 6 - spawns two stymphalides and one io on the three platforms
inviolate purgation - gives everyone two spread debuffs and a stack debuff to two supports and two dps
	these debuffs are numbered from i to iv indicating the order in which they go off
	one role will be spreading and one role will be stacking for each set of debuffs
	a few seconds after they expire, the spread debuffs do giant point-blank aoes where they were taken and the stack does a giant doughnut aoe where it was taken
	the spreads and stacks start on the two northern platforms, unless one of them has the io in which case that role goes south instead
	the stack is taken in line with the bridge at the opposite edge, while the spreads have one in the middle and three using the floor patterns on the edge to resolve
	go back to the middle for healing in between each debuff set
	the stack will always be taken on the same platform but the spreads need to swap over their platforms each time
light of life - a raidwide that happens after the second set of debuffs
light of life - this happens after all debuffs have been resolved
	remember to swap platforms one final time to avoid the final set of giant aoes

forbidden fruit 7 - spawns a stymphalide on two of the three platforms
roots of attis - destroys the central bridge
	the platforms will link with the three separate bridges later
hemitheos's glare - spawns following aoes underneath every player
	stack up at the edge of the platform without a stymphalide
	then move once the aoes spawn and go across the bridge towards the stymphalide not aiming at the platform you were on

famine's harvest - spawns two minotaurs on each platform and a bird on the south and NW platforms
	the two minotaurs on the NE platform need to be baited by two players each
	the other four minotaurs tether to either all supports or all dps
	both birds will dash towards the NE platform
	tethered players need to go onto the other platform with tether minotaurs and hide behind the minotaur diagonally opposite the one they're tethered to
	assign a priority for which players are baiting which minotaurs

death's harvest - spawns birds on two of the platforms and an io on the other, along with two ios on the bridges
	the platform next to both io bridges will always have a bird
	each io will tether to either all supports or all dps and do line aoes towards them
	spread out to avoid overlapping the line aoes and dodge the birds

war's harvest - spawns birds on two of the platforms and an io on the other, along with two minotaurs on the bridges
	the io will tether to either all supports or all dps and the other role gets minotaur and bird tethers
	everybody goes 'far' with their tether
	minotaur tethers go onto the platform opposite the minotaur and hide behind the animal there
	bird tethers go on the bridge opposite the bird, hiding behind the minotaur if needed and use kb resist
	io tethers go towards the bridge opposite the io, with two players on the bridge and two players at the edge of the two platforms next to the bridge
