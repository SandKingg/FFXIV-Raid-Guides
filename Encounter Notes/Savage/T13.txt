flare breath - a heavy-hitting tank cleave

megaflare - does spread aoes on random players, creates some puddles to dodge and marks some other players
	the four marked players need to stack mid to share damage from the follow-up

flare breath

flatten - a big aoe tankbuster

flare breath x3

earth shaker - marks two random players for cone aoes that hit 3 times and leave puddles
	each player should move around the edge of the arena on opposite sides, dropping the puddles as they go

loops from first flare breath until 75%

gigaflare - big raidwide

shadow of meracydia - the shadow of meracydia spawns in the north and should be picked up by the OT and kept at north
	the boss should be south to avoid them tethering and buffing each other
	party focuses this add down

flare star - summons two dark aether orbs that tether to players and can be soaked by moving through
	each soak gives one stack of a debuff that increases damage from rage of bahamut
	try to have every player on 1 stack with tanks maybe taking 2
	the first cast summons the orbs, then the other orbs appear uncast, but will be noted here as another flare star cast
	future loops increase the amount of orbs on each flare star

megaflare - this now spawns a tower at the end that needs to be soaked
flare breath

rage of bahamut - dispels all stacks of the flare star debuff and deals damage based on how many stacks there were
	more stacks = more damage, so it's important to spread the orb soaks between players

loops from shadow of meracydia until ~52% hp

gigaflare

megaflare dive - bahamut and a storm of meracydia lock divebombs on one random player each in sequence, then dive through the arena
	this is immediately followed up by the spread aoes, puddles and stack of megaflare
	keep bahamut as 'new north' and assign priority for running left or running right

add phase - summons  waves of adds
	wave 1 - the pain of meracydia + the blood of meracydia
		the blood will periodically switch its barrier from physical to magical, so target the appropriate add
		the pain just does telegraphed cleaves
	wave 2 - the gust of meracydia x3
		these need to be tanked by the blood tank as the pain will eat any nearby gusts, getting a big buff
	wave 3 - the sin of meracydia x2
		stack up all adds now and kill them quickly
	
	megaflare dive

	wave 4 - the storm of meracydia
		this add casts plummet and death sentence tankbusters
		it will drop a neurolink where it dies, so tank it in a good spot for later
	wave 5 - the blood of meracydia
	wave 6 - the gust of meracydia x2
	wave 7 - the sin of meracydia
	wave 8 - the pain of meracydia
		ensure the gusts are killed by now or tanked away from the pain

	megaflare dive

teraflare - a massive raidwide that needs tank LB3, make sure you're standing in the neurolink too

akh morn - a multi-hit shared tankbuster
	each cast will add one more hit

megaflare + tempest wing - two green tethers spawn on random players that do big wind aoes after a few seconds
	tanks need to grab these and take them away from the party
