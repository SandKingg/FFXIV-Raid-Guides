heavy hand - tankbuster

aetherial shackles - gives one random player a red shackle debuff and one a purple shackle debuff
	after the debuffs expire, they will explode on the three furthest players and three closest players respectively, as well as their original targets
	assign clock spots with cardinals in and intercardinals out
	if you have the red debuff on cardinal or purple on intercardinal, swap with your colour partner
	the far explosions are much bigger than the close explosions, so be careful
	the purple debuff player can be a bit closer to middle to avoid a red player being too close

gaoler's flail - puts down two flails on either side, their weapon showing what will happen
	sickle - a 270-degree cleave with the opposite side being safe
	mace - a point-blank aoe
	chakram - a doughnut aoe
	this first will either be double sickle or mace/chakram in either order

pitiless flail of grace/purgation - a line aoe tankbuster that knocks back the target, make sure to stay close and aim towards a corner
	the buster gives magic vuln, so a swap is needed
	the OT will get an ability targeted on them after the swap based on the cast
		grace - casts true holy, a stack aoe so OT stays with the party
		purgation - casts true flare, a big proximity damage aoe so the OT needs to run away after provoking

gaoler's flail - will be the opposite pattern to the previous

warder's wrath - raidwide

intemperance - splits the arena into a 3x3 grid of cells, either with a stack of three elements
	stay in the cell of your clock spot
intemperate torment - procedurally explodes the elements in their cells either from top to bottom or bottom to top
	if he is raising his fist in the air, it's top to bottom, if he is holding it to the ground, it's bottom to top
	when the elements explode you will gian a fire debuff from the fires and an ice debuff from the ices
	for the second hit, the side cells have lightning, which is an instant kill so everyone needs to either stay in the middle or go north/south
	staying in the middle will keep your debuff the same, but going north/south will switch it to whichever debuff was there
		getting hit by the same twice in a row will give you a damage down
		not having a cell filled will do a big raidwide and give everybody damage down
		getting hit by the small lines between cells will kill you
raidwide - this goes off before the second hit, DO NOT GET BAITED
	in the bad pattern (no stacks with ice on top and bottom) have the dps on 1 and tank on A adjust as follows
		dps on 1 goes 1 > A > A, tank on A goes A > C > 1
raidwide - this goes off after the 2nd hit but before the final hit, make sure to get healed up

pitiless flail of purgation/grace - opposite of the previous

shining cells - a raidwide that changes the arena to alternating sectors of red and blue

aetherflail - uses the flails from earlier, in conjunction with red or white orbs around him
	red orbs explode red sectors, white orbs explode blue sectors
	the flails will have one mace/chakram and one sickle in either order

pitiless flail of grace/purgation
aetherflail

shackles of time - gives a random player a shackle debuff, causing the colour they are standing to all explode when the timer runs out
	have the debuffed player stay still and everyone else adjust

tankbuster

slam shut - a raidwide that transitions the arena back to normal

fourfold shackles - gives everyone a red or purple shackle debuff from aetherial shackles with a different timer
	there will be a red and purple debuff each with 3, 8, 13 and 18 seconds
	have red debuffs go out on intercardinals and purple debuffs stay in on cardinals
	shortest debuffs towards A/1, longest towards D/4 and fill in clockwise like that
	once you are in position, just stay still until all debuffs have resolved
		purple player can optionally run a bit closer to middle to avoid memes

raidwide
intemperance + intemperate torment
gaoler's flail - this will always be in then out and both flails go off between the 2nd and final hits
	wait for the 2nd hit, then go in and towards your spot
	then quickly go out to your spot after the first flail
raidwide
shining cells
shackles of time
pitiless flail of grace/purgation - this entire mechanic resolves before the shackles debuff goes off, but try to stay in the correct colour anyway
raidwide

aetherial shackles + aetherchain x2 - explodes either the red or blue sectors depending on the orbs surrounding him
	the second aetherchain happens right before the shackles resolve so make sure you are in the correct sector in your spot

raidwide
aetherflail x2
aetherflail - this one will be mace/chakram in either order, no sickle
raidwide x3
enrage
