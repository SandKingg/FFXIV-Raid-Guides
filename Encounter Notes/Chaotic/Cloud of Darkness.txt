blade of darkness x2 - the boss draws either one blade back on either side or draws both blades towards her
	one blade means a doughnut aoe close to her on the opposite side of the blade
	two blades means a big point-blank aoe so move away

deluge of darkness - a raidwide and bleed that changes the platform
	her auto-attacks now hit the tanks in every alliance and give lightning vulns
	there are two different timelines for this phase that you can tell apart by the timers on the first grim embrace

timeline 1 (50/1m) -> (42/49/56/1m)
	grim embrace x2 - tethers random players to a crystal in her hand, giving them a debuff
		when the debuff expires, a hand will spawn either in front or behind them and do a small line aoe in front of it
		if she's holding the crystal then the hand spawns behind, so move back
		if she's 'projecting' her hand towards the crystal then the hand spawns in front, so keep moving forward
		the second cast will always be the opposite of the first
		getting hit by a hand gives an esunable doom debuff
		there will be four different debuff timers at the end of the second cast

	razing-volley particle beam - cloudlets of darkness spawn on the outer edges, charging up line aoes in their rows or columns
		these go off in the same order they start charging, just dodge

	flare - gives a random player in each alliance a flare marker
		assign one alliance to each corner and have their member go there, make sure to still dodge the last cleaves

	unholy darkness - a stack marker on all six healers, split into light parties and don't overlap

	blade of darkness - first debuffs go off immediately after this

	enaero/endeath iv - stocks an ability for the next blade of darkness
		aero - knockback
		death - draw-in followed by point-blank into doughnut
		second and third debuffs go off after this

	break iv - look away from the boss and two sinister eyes in the back

	blade of darkness - the stocked ability goes off here
	razing-volley particle beam - the fourth debuffs go off here

	aero/death iv - one of two random abilities
		aero iv - a knockback circle near the boss
		death iv - a draw-in towards a small point-blank aoe, then a doughnut so move in after the point-blank
	
timeline 2 (40/1m) -> (31/55/1m/1m)
	grim embrace x2
	razing-volley particle beam
	aero/death iv - the first set of debuffs goes off after this
	enaero/endeath iv

	rapid-sequence particle beam - a series of line stacks on each alliance
		make sure tanks are in front as the first two players in each stack take more damage
		second set of debuffs go off after this

	razing-volley particle beam
	blade of darkness - remember what she stored before
		third set of debuffs go off after this
	flare - fourth set of debuffs go off after this

flood of darkness - a big raidwide that returns the platform to normal

deluge of darkness 2 - this raidwide transforms the platform differently
	there will be two 'outer' platforms that need six players each on them, while the other players stay on the inner ring of tiles
		ideally there should be one tank, healer and dps in each corner of the inner ring
	the outer players must deal with two stygian shadow adds
	the ring players need to ensure that two players never stand on the same tile, otherwise it breaks and they fall to their deaths
		also, the tiles have a (fairly long) timer that needs to be periodically refreshed

atomos - atomos adds will randomly spawn around the edges and should be killed immediately
	killing them spawns portals on the outer ring that allow players to move into the inner ring of tiles

dark dominion - raidwide

the third art of darkness - each stygian shadow indicates three art of darkness attacks in sequence
	one tentacle glowing - a half platform cleave on that side
	two tentacles glowing - pair stacks on the three closest players
	body glowing - line aoes on every player, make sure not to aim them inside
particle concentration - spawns towers around the whole arena that need differing numbers of players in them
	each outer platform has two 3-person towers either north/south or east/west
	each corner of the ring will have one 2-person tower and one solo tower
	make sure the 2-person tower is soaked on two different tiles

ghastly gloom - either a plus or a doughnut aoe
	look at the clouds around her, if they form a square it's a plus, otherwise it's a doughnut
	outer players need to go onto the ring around the outer edge of the arena to avoid the plus

atomos

curse of darkness - raidwide from the stygian shadows that gives players on the outer platforms a debuff
	they do a small cone aoe in the direction they're facing once the debuff expires, so look away from others
	there are three different debuff timers (7s, 33s & 97s) here, so pay attention

evil seed - gives eight random players a bramble marker, causing them to drop bramble aoes underneath them
	try to put these in the middle of ring edges or on the edge of the outer platforms

ghastly gloom - opposite of previous

thorny vine - tethers players to the nearest bramble, they need to run far away to break the chains
	also, on the inside, two pairs of two players will be tethered together
	they need to run to an adjacent corner (from their starting corner) to break the chains

flood of darkness (shadows) - an interruptible cast on the two stygian shadows

diffusive-force/chaos-condensed particle beam - a spread on every player or six line stacks that need tanks in front
	diffusive-force - orbs around her, spread out
	chaos-condensed - a golden glow around her, stack up with tanks in front

core-lateral/lateral-core phaser - both stygian shadows cast one of two phasers
	the stygian shadows also tether to the outside and move there before casting the phasers, so dodge on the outer ring
	core-lateral - sides safe then front safe
	lateral-core - front safe then sides safe
active-pivot particle beam - the boss begins rotating while shooting line aoes from her front and back
	these repeat until she fires at 90 degrees from her starting position
	outer players can dodge on the outer ring, but inner players need to carefully move around the tiles to avoid getting hit

excruciate - tankbusters from the stygian shadows

atomos

looming chaos - shuffles players around between the inner ring and outer platforms
	the furthest three players on both east and west are swapped with three players inside each
	the other inside players are swapped between each other and remain inside
	the other outside players are swapped to the opposite outside platform
	does a small raidwide too

curse of darkness
particle concentration
core-lateral/lateral-core phaser
raidwide

feint particle beam - spawns following aoes on four players on the inner ring
	run in a consistent direction as soon as the markers appear to avoid getting hit

the third art of darkness
atomos
ghastly gloom
core-lateral/lateral-core phaser
chaos-condensed/diffusive-force particle beam - opposite of the previous
flood of darkness (shadows)

evaporation - both shadows disappear and deal damage to the boss based on their missing hp

flood of darkness
deluge of darkness 3 - goes to the same platform as the first deluge
	this timeline will be the opposite of the first

enrage
