blue shockwave - a massive double-hit cone tankbuster that gives a magic vuln
	both tanks should stand in the northern corners and swap after the first hit

fear of death - a raidwide that spawns 8 hands in two rough columns
	the hands will very quickly do line aoes towards the closest player
	make sure these are baited outside the arena and away from other players
	assign light parties and a role priority from north to south

cold grip - slams both both arms on the left and right, with the glowing arm doing an expanded second hit
	move into the non-glowing arm after it slams

memento mori - shoots a line aoe through the middle that spawns five hands that do line aoes either east or west
	one side will have one line and the other will have four
	the white-glowing wing signifies the side with the single aoe and the dark-glowing wing signifies the side with four aoes
smite of gloom - a big spread aoe on every player
	two players should stay in the small safe spot on the dark side, everyone else spread out on the white side
		can either send ranged dps or have supports just stay on their light party sides and dps always go big
	the line aoe through middle persists and gives a nasty bleed, so make sure not to step into it

soul reaping - stores either a hot wing or hot tail aoe
twofold/fourfold blight - executes the stored aoe, then does either light party stacks or pair stacks
	these aoes are cones so fan out along the boss's hitbox for the hot tail, or very close around north for hot wing

soul reaping - stores the opposite of the previous aoe for later
fear of death

the end's embrace - does small spread aoes on every player that each spawns hands
	the hands do dodgeable line aoes towards the closest player after spawning, so make sure to bait these out and away

tankbusters
twofold/fourfold blight

grand cross - a big raidwide that transforms the platform into a smaller circle, ready for a mini-phase
	stack mid to bait two sets of puddles
	two spinning aoes spawn that count down to when they will shoot line aoes, just dodge
	one role will get spreads and the other role needs to take towers
		the towers can be either cardinals or intercardinals so make sure people know their pairs
	then the roles are reversed, with the second set of towers always being the opposite of the first
	bait two more sets of puddles in mid and towards cardinals respectively
	finally go to intercardinals to avoid the proximity line aoes
neutron ring - another raidwide that returns the platform to normal

add phase - progressively summons eight icy hands and two beckoning hands
	choking grasp - the icy hands do dodgeable line aoes towards the closest players
	muted struggle - the beckoning hands do tankbuster line aoes, but they don't hit very hard

darkness of eternity - a big raidwide that drags everyone into the shadow realm to kill an add based on their role before the doom expires
	tanks - tanks need to kill one icy hands
		spreading fear - an interruptible cast that one-shots you if not interrupted
		choking grasp - these are unavoidable tankbuster line aoes
	healers - healers need to kill one icy hands
		necrotic pulse - an unavoidable line aoe that gives a nasty 35 second bleed, as well as giving a dot to the add
		chilling fingers - an unavoidable line aoe that gives an esunable slow debuff
		choking grasp - these ones are also unavoidable
	DPS - DPS need to kill two icy hands
		choking grasp - dodge the lines
		spreading fear - a long enrage cast at a certain hp threshhold, focus this add down before you die
			separate adds have separate threshholds, some will start enraging after fewer cleaves than others
	use the light to escape the shadow realm after killing your adds

specter of death - summons two giant hands that hit north, mid or south
	if you get hit, you are dragged into the shadow realm again to kill your adds
	make sure to go into the safe spot
the end's embrace - try not to spawn or bait these middle to ensure it stays safe for cold grip
cold grip

relentless reaping - stores hot wing, hot tail, doughnut and point-blank in any order
crop rotation - rotates which aoe in the sequence it starts with
the second/fourth season - executes the aoes in the order they were stored but starting at whichever one was selected by crop rotation
	the final aoe happens at the same time as wither light party or pair stacks, so be prepared

circle of lives - spawns four orbs in the corners and one in the middle
	the orbs will expand one at a time, signifying that they are about to do a doughnut aoe
	it will always be two side orbs, followed by the middle orb, followed by the other two side orbs
specter of death - summons a single hand
	if it's in mid, be patient before dodging in, otherwise be quick dodging out
soul reaping - from now on it can also store either a doughnut or point-blank aoe
twofold/fourfold blight

mass macabre - creates ten summoning circles that need a certain number of players in to lock, giving a magic vuln afterwards
	two 4-player ones in mid should be taken first, with melees taking the north one and ranged taking the south one
	then there are four 3-player ones on the intercardinals towards north and south
	finally there are four 2-player ones on the intercardinals towards east and west
memento mori - split into light party sides and take the four 2-player towers once the vulns run out
	then dodge the hand aoes
tankbusters - make sure one tank consistently has aggro for this one
	the MT party should take the south 3-person tower, then the north one
	the OT party should take the north 3-person tower, then the south one
		the OT can actually help with the north one, since the vuln wears off just before the buster hits
	for uptime, you can have the two melees on the OT side and two ranged on the MT side
		melees take north 2-player tower and ranged take south 2-player on their respective sides
		for the 3-player towers OT side takes both north ones and MT side takes both south ones, moving across once the persistent aoe disappears

circle of lives 2 - this time spawns four circles towards mid, with 2 north and 2 south
specter of death x2 - creates either one hand going through mid or two hands going north and south
