nightbloom

supreme selenomancy - splits the room into a dark half and a light half and gives everyone 4 stacks of the light or dark debuff
	getting 5 stacks gives you doom and kills you, so everyone needs to run onto the opposite half of their debuff
	there are two orbs that do lunar halo doughnut aoes, so stand inside them if you run to that half
	after this, one side begins eclipsing the other, MT should pull the boss towards the smaller side
	you can try to juggle your debuffs on 1 stack until nightfall finishes

nightfall (gun) - stay on the bigger side for debuff optimisation

meteors - OT, one healer and one dps get meteor markers that spawn meteors on their positions
	tank and dps meteor should be placed north and south respectively, on the SMALL colour
	healer meteor should be placed directly east or west on the BIG colour (i.e. opposite of the boss), use sprint here if needed
	the meteors do massive aoes shortly after landing, so go to the safe spot quickly to get the debuff tick before midnight rain
	ideally you should get one debuff tick on your meteor colour, then the next should be on the smaller colour, ensure neither of these kill you

midnight rain - fully makes the arena light or dark (based on which side which larger before)
	dodge the lunar halos
	the meteors then explode once more leaving a puddle of the colour they absorbed previously

antitwilight/perilune - a raidwide that kills anybody not on the opposite colour to the arena
	antitwilight kills if not on dark, perilune kills if not on light
	this also removes the glowing floor and any dark/light debuffs

raidwide

zashiki-asobi - places fans on the ground that do aoes around them shortly after
	this pattern makes one large half unsafe, then the smaller half

nightfall

torment unto death - a cone aoe tankbuster with a swap

supreme selenomancy
nightfall (spear) - do role stack towards meteor spots
meteors
midnight rain
perilune/antitwilight - opposite of previous

dance of the dead - transition raidwide

full/new moon - the next blade attack will have a point-blank/doughnut aoe respectively

bright/dark blade - a large 200-degree cleave on one side of the boss
	make sure boss is pointing north, then bright means east safe and dark means west safe
	make sure to dodge the moon attack as well
