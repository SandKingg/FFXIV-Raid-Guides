roar - raidwide

wyvern's radiance (cleave) x2 - raises one of his claws up and does a cleave on that side, that also hits in line with his body
	the second one is always on the opposite side of the first and happens very quickly after

wyvern's siegeflight - charges through the arena with either a white or red line
guardian resonance + white flash/dragonspark - either a line aoe through the middle or a big hot wing aoe based on whether it was white or red
	this is paired with stacks on each healer, so split into light parties with both an east/west priority and a close/far priority
wyvern's radiance (exalines) - sends a propagating line aoe through the arena
wyvern's radiance (puddles) - two sets of baited puddles under every player
wyvern's siegeflight + guardian resonance + dragonspark/white flash - opposite of the previous

wyvern's radiance (cleave) x2
raidwide

rush - charges through the arena to three spots in a triangle formation
wyvern's radiance (rings) - each spot creates a point-blank aoe, that then propagates out into concentric doughnut aoes

wyvern's ouroblade + wild energy - a halmf room cleave in the direction he's facing, and a spread aoe on each player
	he will always face towards an intercardinal here
	try to have melee spread around the boss and ranged spread at the edge

steeltail thrust - a line aoe from his tail behind him, make sure to stay away

chainblade charge - a stack marker on a healer

wyvern's radiance (cleave) x2
raidwide

guardian resonance (towers + puddles) - spawns six towers, two of which are tankbuster towers
	three sets of puddles are baited under each player before the towers go off
	the towers leave behind crystals
wyvern's vengeance - four sets of four exaflares that travel from mid to the edge of the arena
	any crystals that these touch will explode in point-blank aoes, with the crystals from the tankbuster towers doing much bigger aoes
	one crystal will not get hit by the first exas and will not be hit by a buster tower explosion either
wild energy x2 - spread aoes that hit either all supports or all dps
	these give magic vuln so stay spread

forged fury - a big triple-hit raidwide

raidwide

clamorous chase - leans in with one arm raised and one arm down, giving every player limit cut markers from 1 to 8, with 1 getting a proximity tether
	he charges to each player in sequence, cleaving to the side of whichever arm was raised
	have 1 and 5 go east/west, opposite the lowered arm, 3 and 7 go to the other of east/west
	2 and 6 always go south, 4 and 8 always stay north
	remember to dodge in a bit to avoid the cleave after you get hit

raidwide

guardian resonance (towers + aoes)
wyvern's weal - gives a random player a marker above their head and shoots a laser towards them that follows them across the arena
