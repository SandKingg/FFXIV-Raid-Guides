landslide - a line aoe targeted towards a random player, just dodge

weight of the land - puddles under random players, be quick to move out

mountain buster - an untelegraphed tankbuster that leaves a physical vuln up
	swap at two stacks

tumult - a multi-hit raidwide

loops from landslide until <85% hp

geocrush - titan jumps into the air then lands, doing proximity damage from the centre and destroying the edge of the arena

landslide - now does three line aoes

granite gaols - marks one healer and one dps for gaols, imprisoning them until the gaol is destroyed
	have the healer gaol stand directly underneath titan and the dps gaol at the edge of the arena towards south
	if the gaols are too close there will be a tether between the markers and they gain a vuln down, making them impossible to kill

tankbuster

upheaval - titan raises his leg then stomps down, doing a knockback away from him
	make sure to break the healer free before this goes off
	stand directly under titan and slightly south to avoid falling off
	he should be tanked directly north at this point

landslide - don't break the gaol if this will hit the player immediately, wait a bit instead
