soar - three images of zurvan either fly off in a regular pattern or squished pattern
	if regular, then they fly back at six regular points around the arena
	if squished, then they fly back more squished around north
	every tank and dps then gets a big spread aoe, so they move to assigned spots around the arena
		healers follow another player
		if squished pattern, then move towards the B and 2 markers without overlapping
	then one healer gets a stack and one healer gets a red marker
	everyone stacks in the middle of the arena except the red marker healer

the demon's claw + wave cannon - a big knockback on the MT, which should be towards south
	then a large line aoe that needs to be stacked in, with the OT in front using cooldowns
