runaway train - transports everyone to an alternate dimension for an add phase
	aetherial ray + aetherosote/aetherochar - targets both tanks for a cone tankbuster from the ghost train while the doomtrain shoots either 2 or 3 orbs
		listen out for how many puffs there are to see which is which
		aetherosote - 2 orbs means light party stacks on each healer
		aetherochar - 3 orbs means three random players are targetted for a spread aoe, so everybody needs to stay spread
	loops until the add is destroyed
