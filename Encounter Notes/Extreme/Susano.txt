churning deep - places acceleration bombs on four random players, stay still when the countdown ends

yata-no-kagami - gives a random player a red marker, knocks them back and does two large aoes either side of the line they were knocked back down
brightstorm - a stack marker on the knocked-back player, make sure to get back to the party in time

churning deep

rasen kaikyo - puddles appear under random players, dodge away

thunderhead + yata-no-kagami - summons a cloud that fires a line aoe (the parting clouds) towards the knocked-back player
	make sure to bait the line to cover as little of the safe spot as possible
	getting hit paralyses and leaves a lightning resist down debuff

???

blade's shadow - an interactable that must be clicked by a tank with a cooldown

ame-no-murakumo - the tank needs to do the active time manoeuvre while the party kills the blade
	the blade is doing pulsing sheer force raidwides
	meanwhile the other tank needs to start NE and soak orbs with a cooldown

blade's shadow - swap tanks
ame-no-murakumo

ame no murakumo - a big transition raidwide that leaves a persistent line through the middle of the arena
	players standing in it will sink down until they die

stormsplitter - a line aoe tankbuster that gives a vuln, make sure to tank swap

levinbolt - marks four players one after another with purple markers
	after a few seconds, the side they are on deals raidwide damage so they need to move over to the other side
	standing in the middle zone hits both sides, don't do that
	quote - hark you to the tumultuous heavens

ukehi - a double-hit raidwide

thunderhead + yata-no-kagami + brightstorm
tankbuster
levinbolt
raidwides - there are three hits from here on out

ama-no-iwato - traps a random player in stone, summoning three decoy stones that switch places randomly
	have the trapped player mark themselves so the party can focus down the correct stone
	the player dies if the stone is not killed in time

tankbuster

levinbolt + stun - now each of the four players are stunned, meaning the party needs to adjust instead
	quote - now cometh our part, make way
