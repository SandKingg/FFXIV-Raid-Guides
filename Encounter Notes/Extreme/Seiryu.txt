	two dps get tethered to the red aka-no-shiki, they go to the side and use knockback resist
	one player gets a proximity tether to the blue ao-no-shiki, they go south and the party stacks with them
	then two big iwa-no-shiki appear at the edges and do point-blank aoes followed by tankbuster tethers that need to be pointed away from the party
	ten-no-shiki appear and do line aoes through the platform
	then a big numa-no-shiki appears along with three smaller doro-no-shiki
