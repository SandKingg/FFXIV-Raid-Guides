actualize - raidwide, later on this will return the platform to normal

multidirectional divide - creates two line aoes in a plus shape that cut the arena into four quadrants
	the lines have small thorns that will extend into line aoes
	the big lines will extend into bigger line aoes as well
	the safe spots are in a checkerboard pattern
forward/backward half - one of his two blades will glow, indicating which side will be cleaved
	he will also jump to the side indicated by the cast and cleave in front of him
	essentially if it's forward go to a quadrant in front of him and backward, go to a quadrant behind him
	IF IT'S FORWARD HE WILL TURN AROUND, SO THE BLADE INDICATES THE SAFE SIDE
	make sure you also dodge the checkerboard pattern

multidirectional divide
regicidal rage - two tethers appear on random players, that do tankbusters
	tanks should take the tethers and move away from the party
	make sure to mitigate

dawn of an age - a raidwide that also shrinks the arena to a smaller square, and creates four outer squares next to it

vollok - spawns four blades on each of the outer squares such that every smaller square is filled

sync - selects to adjacent outer squares to sync into reality, causing the swords to be translated over onto the arena square and deal damage in their smaller square
	these are NOT MIRRORED, THEY ARE TRANSLATED
	since each square is covered by exactly one sword, look at one square that is NOT being synced and stand in a sword square there
half full - one blade will be raised and start glowing, indicating there will be a half-room cleave on that side
	stand in a safe spot on the other side

greater gateway - spawns tethers from the outer squares to the arena square
	the southern two squares will have blue normal tethers
	the northern two squares will have fire and wind tethers
blade warp - spawns blades on either the eastern or western platforms
forged track - causes the blades to fly through the tethers
	for the normal tethers, they are always in the same pattern so if the blades are adjacent, the safe rows/columns will be alternating and vice versa
	for the wind tether, there will be a knockback from the line the blade goes through
		stand as close as possible on the long side of the line, without standing in the line itself
	for the fire tether, both adjacent lines will also be unsafe, so stand in the only safe line at the edge
chasm of vollok - gives every player a yellow pyramid marker that causes the square they are on to explode
	spread out into assigned squares so that every player has their own square

actualize

projection of triumph x2 - spawns an array of 16 sword in a 4x4 grid and sends two lines along them
	one line will be point-blanks and the other line will be doughnuts
	either stand on a sword for the doughnut line or away from swords for the point-blanks
	the point-blanks are small enough to dodge half way between two swords
forward/backward half - continue dodging the aoes while getting to the correct safe spot
	the correct sword will always be one of the 8 edge swords, never in the centre or a corner

actualize

projection of turmoil - spawns a moving line from north that does a stack explosion on anybody hit that also gives magic vuln
	also gives everyone a debuff that gets removed when you move through the line, meaning you can run through the line safely from then on
	either split into light parties and cleanse one person at a time
	or do the congaline strat where tanks take first hit solo with mits, then join every subsequent hit with more and more players
	(congaline may be preferable due to the second iteration of this mechanic later)

bitter whirlwind - a triple-hit tankbuster that gives magic vuln, eithe rinvuln or do a double tank swap

dawn of an age - this time only a single other square is spawned

drum of vollok - gives enumeration markers to either all supports or all dps
	assign support-dps pairs for this
	the players who do not have the markers will get launched back through the air from the centre of the marker, and they need to land on the other platform
	make sure everyone is positioned correctly in a line to avoid overlapping pairs

vollok - spawns two larger swords, one on each platform, that take up four squares each
sync + chasm of vollok - both the swords AND each player's explosion get synced across the platform so make sure nobody is overlapping
	have melees take the row closest to the boss and ranged the row behind

aero iii - creates a tornado circle on each platform that launches players similar to the enums from before
	getting launched gives a wind resist down debuff, meaning you cannot get launched again

forward/backward half - based on which way the boss is facing, one role needs to get launched onto the opposite platform
	the cleaves will always hit the first row of squares and the two columns on the side the boss is cleaving

duty's edge - a multi-hit line stack that gives increasing magic vulns with each hit

burning chains - chains all dps to all supports, which need to be broken
	stack up first, then the role that didn't get launched by the tornadoes before, needs to get launched now
	you may need to run back more to break the chains

actualize
projection of triumph x2

half circuit - one blade will be raised and glow, indicating a half room cleave
	at the same time, two blades will appear either in his hitbox or out of his hitbox
	these indicate a point-blank and doughnut aoe respectively
