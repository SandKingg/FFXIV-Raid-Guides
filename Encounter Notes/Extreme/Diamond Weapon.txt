diamond rain - deals damage and applies a vuln for each player on a platform
	need to split into two light parties of four players on each platform to survive

adamant purge - grows claws towards one platform, which will be cleaved, while also doing a follow-up attack
	one light party needs to teleport to the other platform to dodge
	watch the boss or look at the dialogue (dialogue for first phase only):
		ruby/nothing - diamond rain immediately after the cleave, the group that did not teleport before needs to go across (will only happen once in first phase)
		sapphire/chest laser - diamond flash line stack on a random player
		emerald/shoulder pads glowing - homing laser aoes on every player, spread out
	this first one is either sapphire or emerald

photon burst - marks both tanks for flares, stay far away from the other players

adamant purge - always ruby
diamond rain
adamant purge - opposite of first
photon burst

code chi-xi-stigma - transforms into the second phase

auri cyclone - leaps onto both platforms, doing a massive knockback from the blue circles
	also hands tether to every player with proximity tethers
	players need to get knocked back onto the opposite platform to where their hand is
	stand behind the knockback to stay on the platform, or directly to the side to switch

airship's bane - leaps onto one of the airships, destroying it

outrage x2 - raidwide

auri arts (charges) - leaps to the glowing orbs around the airship, charging across between them, then does a final charge across one half of the airship
	stay behind the boss at first on one of the red triangles, wait for the charges then go mid
	look which direction the boss is facing and move out of the way of the charge from the orb it's facing

raidwide

auri doomstead - tankbuster with a swap

auri arts (leaps) - leaps to an orb at one edge of the airship and readies a point-blank aoe
	look at the other end, if there is an orb there, the boss will charge to that and then back to where it started to do the aoe
	stay at the side to avoid the charge
	if there is no orb, then the aoe will be opposite of where the boss starts
	dodge accordingly

vertical cleave - leaps to the final orb on one of the long edges of the airship, doing a knockback
	either use knockback resist or position to not get knocked off
	though it's probably better to save knockback resist for the second one

raidwide

articulated bits - spawns mini hand adds that will do line aoes across one half of the arena

auri arts (charges) 2 - if the hands cover behind the boss, dodge in front but to one of the side triangles to avoid the cleaves
	there will be more line aoes with interspersed safe lines for the final charge

raidwide
tankbuster
articulated bits
auri arts (leaps) 2 - one half of the arena will have line aoes again, so go to the safe spot on the other half
vertical cleave 2 - best to use knockback resist here, don't stand in the line aoes
raidwide

flood ray - marks every player from 1 to 8 and cleaves them in order
	have 1, 2, 3 and 4 go to the markers on the inner airship corners
	one airship is the 'odd' airship, the other is the 'even' airship, can even match colours
	the rest will wait directly in the middle to avoid getting cleaved
	after each player has been cleaved, the next one takes their place
	5 goes to 1, 6 goes to 2 etc
	stay on the platforms you are on, these are new light parties

photon burst
articulated bits
adamant purge - first hands make half of the airships unsafe, wait before teleporting, then dodge hands with the follow-up
diamond rain
articulated bits - hands make one half of the airships unsafe

diamond shrapnel - marks every player for a follow aoe
	stand far back on the unsafe side of the airships, wait for first puddles to spawn, then teleport
	aoes reach slightly into the other platform, so stay safe there

adamant sphere - spawns four towers on each platform while the hands do line aoes through them
	one side needs to stand next to the towers first, then go into them after the line aoes happen
	other side goes straight into the towers
