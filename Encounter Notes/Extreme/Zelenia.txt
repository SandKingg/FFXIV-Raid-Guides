thorned catharsis - raidwide

shock - gives one role doughnut aoes and another role point-blank aoes
	after a few seconds these aoes are placed and persist for a few more seconds
alexandrian holy - spawns four towers at the intercardinals that need to be taken by the role with the doughnuts

specter of the lost - spawns two passable tethers that do cone aoe tankbusters towards their target, make sure both tanks take these

escelons' fall - indicates close or far four times, then does four cone aoes towards either the closest or furthest players
	the patterns will either be 1122 or 1221, meaning swap after the 1st and 3rd hits or after the 2nd hit respectively
	can either resolve this in clock spots, or by having supports spread north and dps spread south

stock break - a multi-hit stack marker

blessed barricade - add phase
	spawns four roseblood drops that need to be destroyed
	there will be two three-person towers that spawn at NE and SW then alternate
spearpoint push x8 - two clones will tether one support and one dps, facing towards them, then do a big cleave on the side that their sword is pointing to
	make sure to aim these so they cleave outside the arena
	the other six players take the towers, with supports west and dps east
	focus the adds next to the tower you're taking

perfumed quietus - a big transition raidwide

rosebud bloom - turns the arena into a field of rosebuds, with some being grey and some tinted red
	the red sections will explode when any part of them is touched by certain aoes, so be careful
alexandrian thunder ii - three rotating cone aoes that explode red spots
	find the largest connected non-red spot and dodge around that with the aoes
alexandrian thunder iii - a spread aoe on every player

raidwide

rosebud: 2nd bloom - there are two safe spots, one has one inner and two outer segments, and the other has the opposite
thunder slash - indicates a point-blank and doughnut in either order, along with six cone aoes
	you need to dodge into the safe spot that has two segments where the second dodge will be
	i.e. if it's doughnut then point-blank, you go to whichever spot has two outer segments, and vice versa
	move into the second of the two segments to dodge the cone aoes

tankbusters

rosebud: 3rd bloom - there are four alternating red zones in the outer segments
	either the north or the south red zone will have the two diagonally adjacent inner segments also red
bud of valor - summons a clone to cast abilities
alexandrian holy - the clone places a tower in each of the outer red segments
emblazon - marks either all supports or all dps with roses, cuasing them to turn the segment they are standing on to red after a few seconds
	we don't want to connect any of the four tower segments, so these need to be placed one bud between the two already red inner segments and three buds opposite
		you can also fill in the four inner segments towards east and west that aren't red
	the role without buds needs to stand in each segment to soak the tower since the buds give magic vuln
	can use rough colour spots to decide which bud goes where, and who soaks the towers

raidwide

bud of valor + shock - only doughnut aoes appear this time, the other role will get nothing
	each role should stack, with supports north and dps south
escelons' fall + alexandrian banish ii - one support and one dps gets a stack marker
	whichever role did not get the doughnuts must take the first bait
	carry on the rest from that starting point

stock break

rosebud: 4th bloom
