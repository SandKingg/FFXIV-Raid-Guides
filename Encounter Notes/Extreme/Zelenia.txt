thorned catharsis - raidwide

shock - gives one role doughnut aoes and another role point-blank aoes
	after a few seconds these aoes are placed and persist for a few more seconds
alexandrian holy - spawns four towers at the intercardinals that need to be taken by the role with the doughnuts

specter of the lost - spawns two passable tethers that do cone aoe tankbusters towards their target, make sure both tanks take these

escelons' fall - indicates close or far four times, then does four cone aoes towards either the closest or furthest players
	the patterns will either be 1122 or 1221, meaning swap after the 1st and 3rd hits or after the 2nd hit respectively
	can either resolve this in clock spots, or by having supports spread north and dps spread south

stock break - a multi-hit stack marker

blessed barricade - add phase
	spawns four roseblood drops that need to be destroyed
	there will be two three-person towers that spawn at NE and SW then alternate
spearpoint push x8 - two clones will tether one support and one dps, facing towards them, then do a big cleave on the side that their sword is pointing to
	make sure to aim these so they cleave outside the arena
	the other six players take the towers, with supports west and dps east
	focus the adds next to the tower you're taking

perfumed quietus - a big transition raidwide

rosebud bloom - turns the arena into a field of rosebuds, with some being grey and some tinted red
	the red sections will explode when any part of them is touched by certain aoes, so be careful
alexandrian thunder ii - three rotating cone aoes that explode red spots
	find the largest connected non-red spot and dodge around that with the aoes
	starting point will always be slightly towards NW or SE
alexandrian thunder iii - a spread aoe on every player

raidwide

rosebud: 2nd bloom - there are two safe spots towards west and east, one has one inner and two outer segments, and the other has the opposite
thunder slash - indicates a point-blank and doughnut in either order, along with six cone aoes
	the cone aoes always alternate, starting north and going clockwise
	you need to dodge into the safe spot that has two segments where the second dodge will be
	i.e. if it's doughnut then point-blank, you go to whichever spot has two outer segments, and vice versa
	if the safe spot is west, then you need to dodge diagonally to avoid the second cone, otherwise just dodge normally

tankbusters

rosebud: 3rd bloom - there are four alternating red zones in the outer segments
	either the north or the south red zone will have the two diagonally adjacent inner segments also red
bud of valor - summons a clone to cast abilities
alexandrian holy - the clone places a tower in each of the outer red segments
emblazon - marks either all supports or all dps with roses, causing them to turn the segment they are standing on to red after a few seconds
	we don't want to connect any of the four tower segments, so these need to be placed one rose between the two already red inner segments and three roses opposite
		you can also fill in the four inner segments towards east and west that aren't red
	the role without roses needs to stand in each segment to soak the tower since the roses give magic vuln
	can use rough colour spots to decide which rose goes where, and who soaks the towers

raidwide

bud of valor + shock - only doughnut aoes appear this time, the other role will get nothing
	each role should stack, with supports north and dps south
escelons' fall + alexandrian banish ii - one support and one dps gets a stack marker
	whichever role did not get the doughnuts must take the first bait
	carry on the rest from that starting point

stock break

rosebud: 4th bloom - two inner segments towards north or south will be red, along with one outer segment there and two outer segments on the opposite side
emblazon - this also creates two static aoes that touch the inner red segments
	the role with roses needs to place theirs in the 2x2 safe spot away from the static aoes
	melees place their on the inner segment and ranged on the outer segment
alexandrian thunder iii - not cast for some reason, but the other role gets spread aoes that need to be taken on the side towards the static aoes
	careful not to overlap
encircling thorns - tethers all supports to all dps
	these tethers break based on distance so stack at the inner part of the large red spot and move dps east and supports west
alexandrian banish iii - this stack has a rose marker so it needs to touch the red segments to make the entire red section act as the stack
	supports shouldn't stand in the red other they get a double magic vuln and die

raidwide

bud of valor - summons one clone at north and one at south
escelons' fall + power break x2 - the north clone does a half room cleave indicated by its sword
	afterwards, solve the entire escelon's fall while watching the south clone
	then dodge the final cleave

stock break

rosebud: 5th bloom - the NW and SE quadrants will all be red and the other two are fully safe
valorous ascension - spawns two sets of two 'briar thorn' slashes at NE and SE in either order
	these then fly through the arena in the order they spawned, with NE hitting east and SE hitting south
thunder slash - first go to the safe quadrant that is not hit by the first briar slash and dodge in or out
	then move either out or in and run clockwise to the other safe quadrant to dodge the cones and cleaves

tankbusters

rosebud: 6th bloom - west will have one inner and one outer safe, diagonally opposite, and the same for east
bud of valor + alexandrian holy - each of the four red segments gets a tower
emblazon - one role will be marked for roses, two need to be placed north and two south
holy hazard - indicates two 120-degree cleaves on opposite sides of the boss, aligned such that they both touch the east-west line
	then it switches to another set, where the safe spots are adjacent on the east and west sides
	if the first set of cleaves keeps the inner towers safe, roses should be placed on the inner segments and vice versa
	then players need to dodge the cleaves and the other role soaks the towers
