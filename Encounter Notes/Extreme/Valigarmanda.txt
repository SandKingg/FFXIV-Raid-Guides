spikesicle - draws arcs on the ground one by one that will fire line aoes, leaving behind exploding ice blocks
	run to the opposite side that the first line shoots towards, then run side to side through the arena three times

skyruin (fire) - changes the element of the arena, dealing damage and leaving a fiery dot

triscourge - a big raidwide that gives everyone debuffs that expire throughout the phase, these will be explained when they happen
	everyone gets lightning
	everyone gets ice, but dps and supports have different durations
	both healers get empowered fire

volcanic eruption - a volcano begins erupting in the background on either the west or the east
	this does a persistent aoe on that side of the arena
	it also spawns three sets of three puddles under random players

animation attack - does one of three different attacks based on his animation
	strangling coil - circles around the arena, doing a doughnut in the middle
	slithering strike - rears up its claws, doing a massive point-blank in front of it
	susurrant breath - gathers energy in its beak, doing an incredibly wide cone attack, only leaving the northern corners safe
charring cataclysm - stacks on either all supports or all dps, assign pairs for this
	for doughnut, you can stack on the edges and be far enough away to avoid clipping
	for point-blank and cone, you can use RMMR or similar for ordering

triscourge (ice) - counts down to doing a persistent deep freeze
	you need to keep moving for a couple of seconds to avoid freezing

mountain fire - spawns six tankbuster towers one by one at the front of the arena, then spews fireballs towards them from its location
	the fireballs give fire resist down and leave a short dot, so tanks need to alternate each strike
	the closest player to the tower (not in the tower) will create a small cone safe spot if they are on the correct side
		the 'correct side' being in line with valigarmanda > tower > player
		so left if the boss is on the right and vice versa, and in the middle if the boss is in the middle
	rampart will not cover the entire duration, so both cooldowns need to be used in sequence to ensure tanks don't die
	being in the wrong place and getting hit by the fire aoe will one-shot you, and failing to soak a tower deals massive raidwide damage and gives a vuln

triscourge (empowered fire) - stacks on both healers, split into light parties
	as this is the fire phase, they are empowered and hit three times, leaving a puddle each time
	staying in the puddle gives a dot, so move out as soon as the puddle spawns
		don't move too quickly though or the puddle spawns as you're moving, leaving less space
	can use the edge of the boss's hitbox as a guide

triscourge (ice) - the other role does their ice
volcanic eruption
animation attack + charring cataclysm

triscourge (lightning) - a small spread aoe on every player

disaster zone - a raidwide that returns the arena to normal

ruin foretold - a big raidwide that spawns three beacons that need to be destroyed
calamitous cry - two line stacks that alternate being on both tanks or both healers each cast, along with cone aoes to dodge
	the line stacks deal more damage to the first target, so have tanks in front
	split into light parties that destroy the northern beacons first then kill the middle beacon
	the stacks also do more damage each time, so try to get through this as quickly as possible

tulidisaster - a triple-hit raidwide of ice, lightning and fire that also leaves a permanent dot at the end

skyruin - can now be one of two options
skyruin (ice) - changes the arena to ice, and leaves a frosty dot

triscourge - once again gives everyone debuffs
	everyone gets lightning, but supports and dps have different durations
	both tanks get empowered ice
	both healers get fire

triscourge (fire & empowered ice)
	empowered ice are massive aoe tankbusters, so have tanks go to the northern corners
	everyone else should stack in light parties, non-empowered fire only hits once and doesn't leave a puddle

avalanche - arrows signify where a large line aoe will go through the platform
animation attack + arcane circles - spawns five arcane circles of ice after the aoe that shoot out line aoes towards the cardinals and intercardinals
	find the safe spot, not in an unsafe column or row

triscourge (lightning) - only one role
spikesicle + avalanche - normal dodge, just don't exaggerate movements for the avalanche
animation attack + arcane circles
avalanche

freezing dust - an icy aoe that freezes anyone not moving, remember to stay moving until the debuff drops

triscourge (lightning) - the other role
disaster zone

ice talon - an aoe tankbuster on the top two in aggro, so OT needs to make sure they are 2

skyruin (lightning) - changes the arena to lightning and leaves a thundery dot

triscourge - once again gives everyone debuffs
	everyone gets empowered lightning, but supports and dps have different durations
	everyone gets ice, but supports and dps have different durations - these will always be opposite of lightning
	both healers get fire

triscourge (fire)

hail of feathers - creates six proximity aoes in each of the non-floaty platforms in sequence that drop down feathers
	one feather needs to be killed before blighted bolt which should be the first to spawn
	respect the proximity damage though

blighted bolt - does a point-blank aoe on each feather, as well as one-shotting anyone on a floaty platform

triscourge (ice & empowered lightning) - ice cannot freeze people on floaty platforms and empowered lightning one-shots on floaty platforms
	so one role needs to spread on the non-floaty platforms while the other just stands on a floaty platform

animation attack + crackling cataclysm - now does baited puddles on every player
	make sure to move instantly, and not to where someone else was standing

arcane spheres + thunderous breath - the lightning arcane spheres do line aoes from either side, so stay in the safe row
	thunderous breath needs to be avoided by being on a floaty platform

triscourge (ice & empowered lightning) - the roles are swapped now
animation attack + crackling cataclysm
disaster zone

ruinfall - spawns a two-person tankbuster tower in the middle of the arena, then does a big knockback from north while tornado puddles spawn in south
	tanks take the tower and everyone just uses kb resist to ignore the mechanic

wrath unfurled - a big raidwide
mountain fire
enrage
