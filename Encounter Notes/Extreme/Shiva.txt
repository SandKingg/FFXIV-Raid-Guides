weapon change - switches to either sword or staff stance, look at her buff or her quote
	sword stance inflicts blunt resist down, staf stance inflicts slash resist down
	you'll either need 1 tank strictly per stance, or just swap each time
	timelines based on which weapon she equips

	sword - a blade of ice to defend my brothers
		icebrand - a massive cone on the MT that needs to be shared by the party
			this is untelegraphed, so make sure to stack quickly

		heavenly strike - a raidwide + knockback

		glacier bash - a dodgeable frontal cone that stuns anyone it hits
			MT should move to the side and slightly behind the boss

	staff - the cycle ends here and now
		hailstorm - spread aoes on every player
			can assign clock spots for this or just do a rough spread, it's very wing-able

		absolute zero x2 - raidwide

icicle impact - spawns two sets of large aoes, with one in the middle and seven around the edges of the arena
	only one cardinal or intercardinal spot will remain safe
	the aoes appear in two waves, so don't move too early until you're sure which one is safe

dreams of ice - grants a stacking damage up, once it reaches 11 stacks, she enrages and wipes the party

weapon change - will do the other phase

loops until <80% hp

adds - summons four ice soldiers that need to be grouped up and killed

dreams of ice (2)
weapon change (sword) - always sword
icebrand

glacier bash
heavenly strike

diamond dust - a big transition raidwide

dreams of ice (3)

icicle impact (sword/staff) - creates four circles at either the cardinals or the intercardinals
	then follows up with four circles on the previously unsafe spots + one in the centre
weapon change (staff) - always staff
hailstorm - this overlaps with the second wave of icicle impacts, so assign players to colour spots with close/far priority
	two players can fit in each safe spot without overlapping the aoes

raidwide x2

dreams of ice (4)

now we get slightly different weapon phases, with a new weapon too

bow phase - a new weapon here (quote is arrows of frost to keep my enemies at bay)
	icicle impact (bow) - spawns the circles going clockwise or anticlockwise, including one in mid, that explode in the order they appeared
		just dodge from the last one to appear into the first

	this phase doesn't give vulns but does a lot of damage as her autos will always crit

	glass dance - a 270-degree cleave in front of her, make sure to dodge behind her after she swaps

	avalanche - marks a random player with a blue marker, then blasts them with a line aoe that knocks them back
		either stand at the side with kb resist, or get knocked through most of the arena
		if not using kb resist, tanks need to position her at the edge to allow for easier execution

	permafrost - coats the arena floor in ice, making it slippery and giving every player a small dot

sword phase
	icicle impact (sword/staff) + icebrand - stack up to share the damage, then move to a safe spot
	permafrost
	glacier bash

	whiteout - a doughnut aoe

	heavenly strike

staff phase
	icicle impact (sword/staff) + hailstorm
	permafrost? - either before the raidwide spam or after
	raidwide x4
	permafrost?
