aethertithe - small, persistent raidwide damage that also turns the floor into contour lines
	there will be three lines that bend towards her, indicating where cone aoes will be
	dodge away from each of the cones
retribute x3 - after each cone there will be two line stacks shot at each healer, assign light parties and stay in line

virtual shift (wind) - a big raidwide that transitions the platform to another stage

laws of wind - two light party stacks on each healer that leave persistent tornadoes, place them NW and SE on the hourglass 'spokes'
	also gives everyone a debuff that will knock them to the left or right once it expires
	make sure to move out of the tornadoes onec they spawn

missing link - chains all dps to all supports, which need to be broken
	have dps run NE and supports run SW

legitimate force - one hand on each side will begin glowing in order, before doing a half room cleave on that side
	the higher hand is always the once that glows first and cleaves first
	immediately after this run to the edge for your knockback debuffs

world shatter - a raidwide that returns the platform to normal

prosecution of war - a double-hit tankbuster that gives a vuln, make sure to swap and mitigate hard

divide and conquer - marks every player with a line aoe in sequence, then fires towards them in the same sequence
	after every player has been hit, the lines hit again exactly where they first hit, so move into a safe spot
	make sure to spread out enough to create safe spots on your light party sides with tanks in the corners, then melee, healers and ranged

royal domain - raidwide

virtual shift (earth) - the earth platforms have a levitator that allows you to walk over the gaps

laws of earth - doesn't really do much, but it will spawn four mini mud towers on each platform later
	have melee take the front towers and ranged take the back towers and decide which side dps are going vs supports

legitimate force - dodge the cleaves, then go down and take your mud towers

gravitational empire - on each side, there will be one player who gets an aoe and one player with a tether and crosshair marker
	also spawns two more mud towers on each platform, one in front and one in the back
	have the tethered players go up and all the way in the northern corners while the aoes stay east/west in max melee
	the two other players take the towers on the platform, supports adjust if there are two melee/two ranged

meteor impact x2 - every player will get a meteor aoe which drops a meteor onto the platform
	make sure you are floating to avoid getting hit
	try to place two meteors in front and two meteors behind for the next mechanic
		other strats do exist e.g. L strat or penis strat
	for the second hit, move over the void to drop your meteor off the platform
	if two meteors are too close, they explode and wipe the raid

weighty blow - spawns four spheres on each side that home in on players on that side one by one
	if a sphere hits a meteor, it dies and the meteor crumbles
	hide behind the back meteors, then move across once both in that line are destroyed
	if a back meteor is hit before a front meteor, make sure to move forward to avoid dying
	if any meteors are left over, it's a wipe

world shatter
tankbusters

coronation - spawns a movable line aoe on each edge and tethers one player to each side of each aoe
	the aoe moves such that it is always halfway between the two players tethered to it
	all players will also get a massive point-blank aoe on them, so they need to be spread
	essentially, we want to make a # symbol by having one player at the midpoint of each edge and one player in each corner
	it is possible for exactly one of the non-north edge players player to get uptime by instead standing in the middle of the arena

absolute authority - does periodic pulsing raidwide damage while also giving every player some debuffs
	either all supports or all dps will get flares, and the other role will get a stack
	every player also gets an abandonment debuff
	start in the NW corner and move along the hitbox edge dropping puddles, then the flares split off and go towards the midpoint and east corners of north/south
	the other role stays stacked, then the flares stack with each other in north and south for abandonment
	finally, there is a big knockback from north but this can easily be knockback resisted

virtual shift (ice)

laws of ice - gives everyone a freezing up debuff that they must keep moving during, and also spawns four ice bridges
	two bridges spawn in the north and two in the south, connecting the three platforms
	if two or more players walk onto a bridge at the same time, it shatters and kills them both

rush - eight icicles will spawn, four in the south and two in both the east and west, that do proximity tethers towards players
	the south ones will tether first, then the east/west ones
	either all supports or all dps will get tethered first and should move across the bridges first
	the outer south tethers should use the north bridges and the inner ones should use the south bridges
	make sure to move across the bridge that takes you away from your icicle
	then, the other role moves across, making sure to cross their tether, i.e. northmost takes the south bridge and southmost takes the north bridge
	make sure to stay spread as getting hit by two icicles will kill you since they leave a short vuln

legitimate force - after spreading for the icicles, get back to the middle quickly
	the role that went out SECOND needs to go back first, as they are closer to the bridges
	use the same bridge you came over on, sprint is handy for the role that comes back second, especially if using the south bridge
	dodge the cleaves on the middle platform

laws of ice

ice dart + raised tribute x4 - ice dart targets two player with passable tethers that do massive aoes while raised tribute is a line stack
	the ice darts need to go to the outer platforms in the northern corners while the line stack stays south and mid
	we rotate while role takes the ice darts one at a time, with tether TAKERS going across the north bridges and tether PASSERS going across the south bridges
