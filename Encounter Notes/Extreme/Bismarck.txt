cetacean rage - bismarck slams into the island, dealing 11 damage to its vitality and staggering every player
	use the magitek field generator to put up a shield, reducing the damage to 5 and removing the stagger
	this first one cannot be shielded though

adds - vanu vanu adds spawn to protect bismarck
	vuk'maii vundu
		powerful gust - a quick cast hit on the tanks
		extreme wind - an aoe targetted at a random player
	lan'maii vundu
		howling wing - a line aoe

cetacean rage
baleen bomb

loops until dragonkillers are fired properly

dragonkillers - a message appears on scren indicating that the dragonkillers can be used
	two players need to activate the dragonkillers to reel in bismarck
	need to activate before the next baleen bombs hit them, disabling them

chitin carapace - kill the carapace, make sure to be on bismarck to be able to deal damage
	while on bismarck, players gain stacks of turbulence, which is a stacking dot and vuln up
		players should aim to never get more than 3 stacks
	if bismarck begins shaking, jump back onto the platform, but one round should be enough to kill the carapace

add phase - two sanuwas spawn, which need to be tanked, ul'sanuwa is water and so'sanuwa is wind
	make sure to keep the sanuwas apart and face the cleaves away from the group
	baleen bombs will keep occuring without being cast by bismarck in this phase

	tornadoes - tornadoes will spawn and move around the arena, getting hit deals damage and knocks you into the air

	dead wind/water - gives everyone a wind or water debuff
		attack the add that has the opposite element of your debuff

	dead wind/water - rerolls everyone's debuffs, you might get the same or different so pay attention

	loops from dead wind/water until enrage

breach blast - a big transition raidwide that also destroys the magitek field generation

adds 2 - spawns the same two adds as in the first phase, with a new add as well
	nat'maii vundu
		death blossom - a small point-blank aoe around it

cetacean rage

windcaller - indicated by a message saying bismarck seizes control of the clouds, different mechanics happen based on the weather
	vapor bubbles spawn in all weathers, causing many more baleen bombs to appear

	thunder - weather is thunderstorms
		lightning bolt - aoes on three random players, make sure to spread out
		thunderhead - two bigger hitting aoes on any vapor bubbles alive
			if no vapor bubbles are alive, then players take these hits instead to leave the bubbles alive for thunder
	wind - note that the weather is SHOWERS here, despite not being the rain phase
		sharp gust - a knockback from the middle of the platform
		rain storm - a doughnut aoe where the middle of the platform is safe
	water - weather is rain
		primal tears - a large blast of water in the middle of the platform that deals damage and gives vuln up to anyone hit
		deep draught - gives a damage up to any surviving vapor bubbles, make sure they are dead by then

dragonkillers

corona - exactly the same as chitin carapace phase except the corona has more health, you'll likely need two rounds to kill it
	if you need two, make sure to wait after the first to let your debuffs wear off

loops from adds 2 until the island dies
