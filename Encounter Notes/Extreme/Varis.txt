altius - spawns a garlean cross behind every player that will shoot forwards in a line after a delay
	usually try to have these firing north/south

alea iacta est - turns to a random player and does four cleaves in front of the boss and one behind

citius - double stack tankbuster

ignis est - turns to a random player, casting a fiery garlean cross which shoots forward combined with a point-blank aoe
festina lente - targets both healers with stack markers, split into light parties
	make sure to stay out of the ignis aoe

electrified gunshield + altius + ignis est - charges up his shield and does a knockback at 100
	bait altius north/south first
	then move out and either quickly back in or use kb resist at ~85

reinforced gunshield + tankbuster - charges up his shield and does a directional parry at 100
	will either be sides safe or front/back safe
	stop attacking slightly before to avoid getting hit
	MT should not move the boss in case front/back are shielded

loaded gunshield + ventus est - charges up his shield and does spread aoes on each player at 100
	then turns to a random player and does a windy garlean cross which shoots forward combined with a doughnut aoe
	stay in then go to clock spots, whoever has the cross on their spot needs to wait at someone else's spot first

vivere militare est - tanks use a cooldown and click on the interactible, party kills the cross

the next part is split into three 'enhanced gunshield' mini-phases which happen in a random order

electrified mini-phase
	electrified gunshield + reinforcements + terminus est - calls in some adds
		magitek turret i - shoots line aoes, just kill them
		magitek turret ii - does a tankbuster tether on a player
		terminus est - line aoes from north, go into the safe column
		remember the knockback at the end
	alea iacta est

reinforced mini-phase
	reinforced gunshield + altius + ventus est - bait altius north/south, then wait for ventus before moving and make sure to stop attacking for reinforced
	tankbuster

loaded mini-phase
	loaded gunshield + ignis est - clock spots and out, much easier to dodge the cross here
	festina lente + terminus est - have a north/south priority for the light parties in the safe column
	tankbuster

gunshield - mini phase, kill the gunshield
	magitek torch/magitek spark
		torch - a line stack
		spark - does thin cone aoes on each player, need to spread
			have tanks closest to mid, then melee, ranged and healers for each light party on their respective sides
	magitek spark/torch - the opposite to first cast
	nothing
	literally nothing
	enrage

loaded gunshield + fortius - do the fortius dance, then stay spread
	clock spots and out first to drop puddles
	then in, then step slightly to the side, then back to where you were
	stay spread
festina lente

tankbuster

electrified gunshield + terminus est + fortius - fortius dance, then into safe column, then knockback

altius + terminus est + festina lente + ventus est + alea iacta est - lots of mechs here
	first bait altius north/south in mid
	light parties go into the safe column with their n/s priority
	stay in the safe column to dodge the cleaves
	stay close to varis to dodge the ventus doughnut, while also dodging the cleaves
	you can safely stand in front of the ventus cross for the front cleaves but NOT for the back cleave, be careful with baiting

tankbuster

ignis est + alea iacta est - go quickly out after moving through, the ignis goes off right after the final cleave

loops from loaded gunshield + fortius + festina lente until enrage
