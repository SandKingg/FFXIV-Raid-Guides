elegeia unforgotten - big raidwide, summons a head in the middle of the arena and two planets on the outside
	the planets will rotate around, one slow and one fast, until they collide at an intercardinal
	blue planets do a big knockback, orange planets do a big point blank
		go towards or opposite the planets respectively
	the head casts diairesis which is a half-room cleave, need to dodge that and the planet mechanic

katasterismoi - spawns two columns of four towers, assign supports to one side and dps to the other, melees in front
grip of despair - chains supports to dps, need to stack together and then run away to break them
elenchos - either does a big line aoe through the middle column of the arena or two line aoes at the side columns
	look at the boss, vomiting is mid aoe and crying is side aoes

telos - raidwide

hubris - tankbusters on top two aggro targets

elegeia unforgotten
eironeia - two stack markers on each of the healers, split into light parties to soak
	will need north/south priority for later in the fight

fatalism - repeats the previous planet mechanic twice, without the head
	double orange - dodge one aoe then the other
	double blue - get knocked directly to the next one
elenchos

twinsong's aporrhoia (aka 5head) - summons five heads on the arena, four near the corners and one in the middle
	the middle head casts the diairesis half-room cleaves
	the corner heads cast either necrotic fluid or wave of nausea
		these are either a doughnut or point blank aoe
	move into a doughnut and dodge the half-room cleave
aporrhoia unforgotten - 'records' each of the aoes
	this pattern happens three times, moving one spot clockwise each time
theological fatalism - spawns rings around each of the heads that signals how many instances are being 'rewinded'
	first look at the middle head to see which half is safe
	then look for a head that was previously doughnut with either 1 or 3 rings OR a head that was previously point blank with 2 rings
elenchos

tankbusters

despair unforgotten - each of these casts will do one of three patterns, all of which happen once each
	1 - everyone gets a big point blank aoe under them
		move to clock spots
	2 - supports get flare markers, one dps gets a stack and the others get doughnut aoes
		supports move out, dps stack in the middle
	3 - one support gets a stack and the others get doughnut aoes, dps get flare markers
		dps move out, supports stack in the middle

elenchos
despair unforgotten
theological fatalism 2 - players get rings signalling how many rewinds are happening
	if your rings take you back to a stack or doughnut, stack in the middle, otherwise stay on the outside

telomania - multihit raidwide with a bleed at the end

endsong's aporrhoia (aka 6head) - summons six heads in a hexagon pattern around the room, then rings fly towards four heads at a time causing them to cast endsong, a point blank aoe
	run towards the heads that don't have rings flying towards them
	this happens three times, with the first time coming form endsinger herself and the other times from the heads
	for the first time, one side (east/west) will have one ring and one side will have three rings, go to the side with one ring

fatalism x2 - will either be double blue into double orange or vice versa
