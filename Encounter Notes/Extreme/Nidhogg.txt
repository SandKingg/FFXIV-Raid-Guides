cauterize - nidhogg leaves the arena, reappearing on the north or east edge and doing a charge through the arena
horrid roar - creates puddles under four random players, and gives markers to four other players
	dodge the puddles and dash, and spread out to avoid overlapping the markers

cauterize + horrid roar

touchdown - nidhogg slams down, doing raidwide damage

hot wing/tail - turns to a random player, casting this ability
	wing - two large aoes to the sides of him, stay in line with the boss
	tail - a line aoe through the arena in the direction he's facing, move to the sides

hot tail/wing + horrid roar (puddles) - always the opposite

loops from cauterize until <80% hp

add phase - summons three adds that need to be killed in the order brobinyak > falak > dragon
	shadow brobinyak - should be tanked
		the serpent's apple - a tankbuster that gives physical vuln, make sure to use cooldowns
		original sin - a magic attack that inflicts heavy
			starts casting this after ~3 tankbusters
			since the falak gives magic vuln up, the falak tank can never swap to this add, which is why we kill it first
	shadow falak - should be tanked
		electric predation - a tankbuster that gives magical vuln, make sure to use cooldowns
			brobinyak tank should provoke after brob is dead, to avoid too many stacks
	shadow dragon - cannot be tanked, assign one player to bait
		fireball - targets the furthest away player, doing a delayed aoe where they are standing that gives damage down
			need a ranged player to bait
		ripper claw - an aoe cleave in front of it that gives damage down

mortal chorus + final chorus - a big transition raidwide

high jump - marks four random players with aoes that leave behind puddles, take these to the edges
geirskogul - a line aoe from each of the four puddles, as well as the boss
soul tether - a purple tether on a random player that needs to be intercepted by the OT
	use a cooldown, it's a buster

ala morn - tankbuster

nidhogg's fang/claw - creates a red claw and blue fang that chain to three random players each
	MT will ALWAYS get a blue chain, meaning a tankswap is needed
	the claw can only be damaged by red-chained players taking damage, the fang must be killed normally
	if blue-chained players take damage, they heal the fang, so avoid this at all costs
orbs - three orbs spawn randomly around the arena, exploding and dealing damage in an aoe when a player runs into them
	red-chained players need to take these to damage the claw
eye of the tyrant - a stack marker on a random blue-chained player, have red players stack with them
	NO OTHER BLUE-CHAINED PLAYERS CAN TAKE THIS STACK
fang/clawbound - the chains are randomly reassigned again, requiring another tank swap
loops until fang & claw die or enrage

tankbuster x2

high jump + darkdragon dive + soul tether - both healers get high jump, and four towers spawn near the corners of the arena
	split into pairs with tanks and healers going to the north corners and dps going to the south corners
	tanks should take towers while healers place their puddles far in the corner
	dps can have both in the tower
	tanks need to intercept the soul tether that targets the healers
high jump - four more random players get high jump puddles that need to be placed at the edge
geirskogul - line aoes spawn from each of the puddles, make sure to dodge
super jump - a proximity marker that spawns on a random puddle, run as far away as possible

tankbuster

bloodrage - a transition raidwide

cauterize + horrid roar - this time six players get horrid roar puddles and six get markers too
touchdown

bitter hate - a stacking debuff on the MT that kills them if it reaches 8, usually there is a swap after each akh morn (not the first)

akh morn - a multi-hit stack marker that increases in hits each time it's cast, starting at 5?

scarlet orbs - places two sets of scarlet orbs on opposite corners, then one set in mid
	these will eventually explode in the cardinal directions, bomberman style
horrid roar (puddles) - place them on the edge of nidhogg's hitbox, then immediately run to the centre
hot wing - as soon as hot wing goes off, run to your assigned corner (same as for darkdragon dive)
horrid roar (markers) - spread out to avoid overlap

akh morn

scarlet orbs 2 - this time the orbs spawn in one at a time, with mid being first, then two opposite corners
	run to the corner of the final orbs to spawn and stand right in the corner
horrid roar (puddles) - move just out of the puddles' aoes once they're placed, then run diagonally forwards once the first orbs explode
hot tail

loops from first akh morn until enrage
