-- PHASE 1 --
optimized ultima - raidwide

magitek bit - summons adds that shoot line aoes, bait these away from safe spots first

flexiclaw - first is always helicoclaw
	helicoclaw - creates three curved lines of point blank aoes, make sure to bait lines then move
		safe spots are slightly further along than the 'dimple' between two aoes
		this happens twice

stamp - tankbuster + swap

flexiclaw - second is always ravensclaw
	ravensclaw - creates four short and four long lines that explode at the tips
		assign clock spots such that there's one melee and one ranged in each colour pair
		may need to switch in colour pairs based on short/long positioning
	ruby sphere + liquefaction/undermine - spawns three aoes under each player, placed differently based on the mechanic
		liquefaction - causes the ground to become quicksand except the lines
			melees take short lines and ranged take long lines to place aoes on
		undermine - causes the lines to erupt into aoes, so stand away
			place aoes in a 'triangle' formation in the corners of the safe spots

ruby ray - faces a random player and blasts a big line aoe towards them, go behind

flexiclaw + liquefaction - turns some of the arena to quicksand, keeping a safe spot in mid
ravensflight - a series of line aoes through the room
	first dodge towards the corner outside of the initial charge and the perpendicular charge
	then look for the safe side from the cleave and dodge to there
	then sprint over to the opposite side, as the quicksand shifts to be only in mid and the outer ring is now safe

raidwide
tankbuster

ruby dynamics - stay inside the boss's hitbox and go into light parties for stacks

cut and run - the boss charges through the middle doing a series of big cones in front of it, while every player has a spread marker
	split into the same sides and light parties, tanks closest to the boss then melee, ranged and healers
	go north/south for the proximity blasts at the end, tanks should be north so the boss isn't stuck on the edge

ruby ray
raidwide
flexiclaw + ravensclaw 2
ruby sphere + undermine/liquefaction - opposite of previous
ruby ray
raidwide
flexiclaw + liquefaction
ravensflight 2 - this time it's out safe first then mid, players should run mid and dodge to the safe side from the claw
raidwide
tankbuster
ruby dynamics
cut and run
ruby ray
raidwide
enrage - also cast once the boss gets to low enough hp


-- PHASE 2 --
meteor project - starts a bar charging up to 100, will do a raidwide once full

negative personae - summons two adds, one blue and one orange and gives everyone a debuff
	attack the add of the opposite colour to the debuff
	keep them apart on opposite sides, slightly further north

	meteor stream - aoes on dps that need to be spread out

	greater memory - spawns coloured heads that tether to dps and need to be kited into the add of the opposite colour

	lunar dynamo/iron chariot - in/out respectively

	meteor stream

	ruby claw - multi-hit tankbuster

	change of heart - switches everyone's debuffs

	greater memory
	dynamo/chariot
	tankbuster

	negative aura - look away from the boss

meteor project

meteor mine + magitek meteor - marks each player with 1 to 8 and eventually spawns a proximity marker in that order
	players should spread to clocks at the edge except number 8 who should be close to the edge of the hitbox
	move in to mid after the proximity spawns
screech - GET KNOCKED BACK behind the rock that number 8 spawned for magitek meteor
	then run away as each meteor explodes

mark ii magitek comet - spawns two comet markers that move along the ground before falling down
	tanks need to stand in the final circles with mitigation and players destroy the meteors
bradamante - marks two players for line aoes that need to be shot away from the tanks
