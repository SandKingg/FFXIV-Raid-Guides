ancient double - doubles all abilities

shadow spread - a cone aoe on each player, then again where they were standing
	assign clock spots then move after the first attack

bad faith - two walls of arrows in mid that point in opposite directions and fire through two opposite quadrants, these then reverse for the next hit
	dodge one, then move into an adjacent quadrant to dodge the next

ravenous assault - double hit tankbuster with a swap

arcane utterance - either creates red arcane globes or blue arcane fonts
arcane control - activates the objects
	globes -  these explode in point-blank aoes, move into the gap where there is no orb
	fonts - these fire lasers in the direction they're facing, move directly opposite of the gap

broken faith - circles fall from the sky, doing point-blank aoes indicated by the lines on the floor
	each area gets hit twice during the mechanic
	the usual strat is to dodge from mid to 1st hit and back and forth

arcane utterance + arcane control 2 - opposite of previous
shadow spread
bad faith
tankbusters
enrage - get below 10% to skip

add phase - a long battle with multiple ascian shades
	nabriales's shade
		comet - two sets of four meteor towers spawn at north and south
			each tank needs to stand in them with mitigation to soak the damage
			usually MT takes north, OT takes south
		dark ii - adds tether all dps and shoot a cone aoe towards them
			this cone givse magic vuln so need to shoot away from tanks (and other dps)
			directly north/south is best
		ancient water iii + ancient darkness - a stack on each healer and a spread on each tank
			assign light parties based on clock spots and position max melee
			this allows tanks to stay away from stacks with their aoes but maintain uptime
		quake iii - nabriales is casting this throughout the phase, it deals damage based on his hp at the end of the cast so get him low enough to survive

	lahabrea's shade + igeyorhm's shade - lahabrea spawns east, igeyorhm west, assign tanks for each
		fire sphere + blizzard sphere - gives fire and ice debuffs to players
			tanks will get opposite debuffs, healers will get opposite debuffs and 2 dps will get each
			attack the add OPPOSITE to your debuff
				fire attack igeyorhm, ice attack lahabrea
			tanks may need to provoke and dash over if they get 'incorrect' debuffs
			after getting your correct add, take them north a bit
		fire iv + blizzard iv - tankbusters
		dark flame + dark freeze - ice and fire tethers spawn in the intercardinals, need to be taken by someone of the opposite debuff
			because of how swapping worked, tanks are ALWAYS correct here, so they can take northern tethers
			healers take southern tethers, but they will need to swap sides
		fire sphere + blizzard sphere 2 - debuffs swap over now, swap sides and keep the adds still
		tankbusters x2
		enrage

	ascian prime's shade
		universal manipulation - a big raidwide that gives everyone debuffs
			supports get doom, ancient circle and cursed shriek
				doom - heal to full
				ancient circle - a massive doughnut aoe
				cursed shriek - a gaze attack centred on that player
			dps get off-balance, beyond death and forked lightning
				off-balance - taking damage knocks you back
				beyond death - need to take lethal damage once
				forked lightning - a point-blank aoe
			supports and dps pair up on the cardinals, with dps standing slightly behind supports
			dps need to get hit by ONE doughnut to get knocked back
			then everyone looks away from supports
			dps stay out until their forked lightning aoes go off
		blight - raidwide + bleed
		height of chaos - an aoe tankbuster
		megiddo flame - a line stack on each healer, split into light parties
		shadow flare - raidwide
		ancient eruption - baited aoe puddles on the furthest away player, have a ranged dps do this
		raidwide x2
		...?
		enrage

again the majestic - summons the comets from nabriales's shade
	tanks take them exactly the same as before

captivity - targets one healer for a big aoe that stunes and captures anyone caught inside in an aetherial gaol, stay away
chorus of the lost - kills anyone trapped inside the gaol, make sure to kill it before then

again the martyr - gives every dps an icy aoe and each healer a stack
	pre-position inside the octagon with tanks and healers stacked east/west and dps ready to go to their intercardinals
wail of the lost - a big knockback from the centre, if you're outside the octagon you'll probably get knocked off

again the abyssal celebrant - marks both healers for multi-hit line stacks and the two furthest players for aoe puddle baits
bident - causes multiple aoe cones to fire through the arena, leaving two northern safe spots and two big middle safe spots
	have two ranged dps go all the way south in the mid safe spots to bait their puddles
	everyone else split into their light parties and take the stacks with the healers in the northern safe spots

dark seal - causes three expanding aoes to spawn, with two on one side and one on the other
	eventually, the side with one will be safe

shadow stream/polydegmon's purgation - one of two abilities
	shadow stream - a line aoe through the middle of the arena
	polydegmon's purgation - two line aoes on the east and west sides of the arena, stay mid

polydegmon's purgation/shadow stream - opposite of previous
dark seal
shadow stream/polydegmon's purgation
polydegmon's purgation/shadow stream
enrage - get below 30% to skip

life in captivity - traps everyone in chains, do the qte to escape

dark current - spawns exaflares on each side of the platform that travel across, followed by another set of exaflares
	always start west in whichever spot is safe first
	then wait for two blasts and move up/down (whichever gives melee uptime while being safe)
	wait for two blasts again, then move back

gigantomachy - raidwide

quadrastrike - two raidwide hits, followed by tankbuster towers, then a final big raidwide + bleed
	assign a side for each tank, can be MT east and OT west for consistency with light parties

dark current
gigantomachy
quadrastrike
