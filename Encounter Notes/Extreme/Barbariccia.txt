void aero iv - raidwide

savage barbery - points an arrow to a random cardinal and then either lifts her sword over her shoulder, or points it towards the ground
	if it's a lift, then she does a line aoe perpendicular to the arrow, stay out of her hitbox
	if it's a point, then she does a doughnut aoe, stay in her hitbox
	the arrow indicates where she'll throw her sword to do a big point-blank aoe, so always dodge opposite of the arrow

hair raid + hair spray - either crouches down or floats in the air, along with marking players with spreads or stacks
	if she crouches, then she will rush to the wall she threw the sword to and do a big roomwide cleave, we need to be at the wall to her sides
		if stacks, assign light parties and each light party takes a specific side
		if spreads, use the same light party sides, but have melees+tanks next to her, then ranged dps, then healers, tanks move out as soon as the cleave goes off
	if she floats, then she will do another doughnut aoe
		if stacks, assign light parties and stay in her hitbox, don't overlap
		if spreads, stay in her hitbox and preposition to your assigned clock spots, then move after the doughnut aoe goes off

savage barbery - opposite of the first one
hair raid + hair spray - both opposite of the first one
raidwide

void aero iii - tankbuster + swap

teasing tangles - marks areas in each cardinal then each drag two players towards them, exiting will drag them back to the middle of the area and leave a nasty dot
	two players get enumeration markers, four players get big aoes and two players get nothing
	enums and nothing go towards the 2 and 4 markers, big aoes go far away and towards the 1 and 3 markers
secret breeze - does four cone aoes towards each cardinal, then another cone on each player
	make sure you spread out quickly after the aoes go off to avoid overlapping cones

raidwide

curling iron - transforms into the second phase, while making her hitbox unsafe
katabasis - big transition raidwide

brutal rush (supports) - marks every support for a line aoe, preposition in clock spots and dodge to the side after she punches towards you

boulder break - double stack tankbuster, usually just invulned

boulder + brittle boulder - marks everyone with baited puddles, then for spread aoes
	everyone goes mid until the puddles are baited, then go to clock spots
	mind the curved line aoes and leave space for people to run to

upbraid - either all dps or all supports get enumeration markers, have one set rotate clockwise to stack with their partners
	don't make healers rotate unless you have a BLM or something

brutal rush (dps)

knuckle drum - a series of big raidwides, stack at A during this

blow away + brutal rush - baits four puddles under each player, run clockwise from A during this to dodge the burtal rushes at the same time

impact + bold boulder - marks both tanks with flare markers, and a random healer with a stack, then does a knockback from the centre
	party stacks at C while tank flares go to 1 and 4 and use a cd
	remember the knockback here, don't go to the edge (unless you used kb resist)

brutal rush (dps) - spread quickly after the stack to help dodging
teasing tangles 2 - this time four players get enumerations but it always works out that you can resolve them at the numbers
	dodge the small tornadoes, as well as the two sets of three puddles that are ROUGHLY baited near players
	you get time to move after the final puddle goes off, but be quick
knuckle drum

iron out - moves back to first form

entanglement - marks everyone with a playstation symbol then entwines them in a small tangle, leaving early drags you back and gives a nasty dot again
	go to the intercardinal same colour as the marker (greens are yellow markers)
secret breeze - choose a side of the tangle to dodge to, staying in intercardinals and remaining spread for the player cones

savage barbery
hair raid + hair spray
raidwide
