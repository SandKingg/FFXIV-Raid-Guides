inferno - raidwide

ordeal of purgation - summons three concentric rings on the arena with some rotating around
	there are runes at the edges that summon a cone (triangle) or half-room cleave (rectangle)
	follow the fireball's path with your eyes to see which r une it ends up at and activates
	the runes WILL move with the outer ring
	you get bound before the effects go off so no adjusting
ordeal of purgation 2 - summons two fireballs that will both activate a rune
	this pattern always has a safe spot on the quadrant opposite the 'arrow' (two lines at 90 degrees)

shattering heat - tankbuster

arch inferno - summons big rotating aoes around the arena and a constant aoe in the middle
	split into light parties for upcoming mechanics
random mechanic - can be any one of three
	fourfold flame - a stack marker on each healer
	twinfold flame - enumerations on all supports or all dps, split into melee/ranged pairs
	spike of flame - spread markers on every player
conflagration - a line aoe, you have time to dodge through it
random mechanic - will be different to the first one you saw

radial flagration - a thin cone aoe on every player, go into clock spots

raidwide

ordeal of purgation 3 - all runes are triangles this time
	will either be two adjacent runes or with a gap of one
	safe spot always halfway between them, need to be further back for adjacent patterns
ordeal of purgation 4 - all runes are rectangles this time
	look for the 'cat ears' and go into the second ear that the arrows rotate into

add phase - spawns five flamesent and one greater flamesent
	greater flamesent - casts ghastly torch that stacks up burns on everyone, focus this one down
	flamesent (south) - cast ghastly wind tethers on random non-tanks that should be pointed away
	flamesent (NE/NW) - cast shattering heat tethers on random players that need to be picke dup by the tanks
	flamesent (north middle) - casts ghastly flame puddles that should be avoided
blazing rapture - big transition raidwide

flamespire brand - marks everyone with a spread, either all supports or all dps with flares and one of the opposite group with a stack
flamerake - spins a four-pointed arrow that will eventually explode into cascading line aoes, starting either cardinals or intercardinals
	everyone starts on colour pairs and dodges the first aoes
	stack and free players move into the middle to take the stack while flares move to the other marker of their colour and towards the edge of the arena
	free players move out a bit towards the marker they started at, flared players move in a bit on their markers

inferno (empowered) - does a spread aoe on every player

scalding signal/ring - either a point-blank or doughnut aoe respectively, also casts scalding fleet line aoes on every player
	need to be in clock spots for the lines and out or in respectively
sweeping immolation - faces a random cardinal or intercardinal and displays either a big star or multiple little stars on his cloak
	there will be a big half-room cleave in the direction he's facing so go behind him
	if it's a big star, then everybody stacks for total immolation
	if it's multiple little stars, then assign spread positions for partial immolation, two per slice of the arena
	the scalding fleet lines will happen again but going through the whole arena this time, from where they ended up
	don't be too close or you get clipped by the thick lines

dualfire - two very wide cone aoes on the tanks, have MT on 1 and OT on 2 with party behind the boss

ordeal of purgation 5 - just use eyes for this one
ordeal of purgation 6 - will be one rectangle and one triangle next to each other
	the safe spot is at the other rectangle adjacent to the active triangle
	but be on the other side of the line to dodge the half-room cleave

raidwide

flamespire claw - marks every player from 1 to 8 and spawns two tethers, then cleaves each player in order
	the player with 1 goes to 1 and 2 goes to 2, with odds and evens on their respective parity's side
	7 and 8 will stay close to the boss at south to bait the tethers on them
	after a player has been cleaved, they pick up the tether and the next person takes their place at 1 or 2

scalding ring/signal - the opposite of the first pattern
