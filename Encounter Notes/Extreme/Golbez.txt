terrastorm - summons two massive boulders that fly towards opposite corners and do huge point-blank aoes
	stand in the two opposing safe corners

lingering spark - invisible baited puddles under every player
	stack first (except MT), wait until the cast is finished then move away

phases of the blade - turns to a random player doing a massive half-room cleave in front of him, then behind him
	make sure to quickly move through after the first cleave

binding cold - raidwide + dot

gale sphere - spawns four clones towards the cardinals that correspond to the order that the orbs shoot line aoes through the arena
	the first two clones are north/south in either order and the last two are east/west in either order
arctic assault - spawns two walls of icicles in the middle of the room that will shoot in the direction they're facing
	this makes two quadrants unsafe (for this mechanic, it's always two diagonally opposite ones)
	dodge this at the same time as the second set of gale spheres

phases of the blade
raidwide

void meteor - multi-hit tankbusters on both tanks, where the final hit does way more damage than the rest

azdaja's shadow + black fang - big transition raidwide

azdaja's shadow - imbues his blade with azdaja's power, either showing particles close to him or all around the arena
	if close, then prepare for a point-blank aoe on phases of the shadow
	if everywhere, then prepare for a doughnut aoe on phases of the shadow
	also makes the next three auto attacks do tankbuster line aoes
	if one person takes all three hits, they die, so make sure to swap somewhere
	can either do a pseudo-swap where OT takes the 2nd hit and MT provokes back, or a proper swap after the 2nd hit
		if doing a pseudo-swap, don't use shirk until the 2nd azdaja's shadow later in the fight as this aligns them better

phases of the shadow + immolating/burning shade - casts phases of the blade with either a point-blank aoe or doughnut aoe centred on the boss
	this is based on the azdaja's shadow particle effects
	if point-blank then you get immolating shade, if doughnut, then you get burning shade
	immolating shade - a stack marker on each healer, split into light parties with east/west priority
		healers move slightly in after the aoe so melees can keep uptime
	burning shade - a spread aoe on every player, stay in then move to clock spots

double meteor - marks one healer with a knockback centred on them, one support and one dps for a flare, and spawns two towers in opposite corners
	the northern tower needs three people, while the southern tower needs two
	the knockback healer will stand directly in the middle of the arena, while everyone else positions around them
	flares will get knocked into the non-tower corners, everyone else get knocked into a tower
	dps get knocked north, supports get knocked south
	finally, the knockback healer will get a baitable line aoe which they need to bait directly south

azdaja's shadow - opposite of the previous effect

void stardust - spawns two exaflares in opposite corners that cover one half of the arena each
	light parties should have north/south priorities for this
	go next to the exaflare in its final spot (indicated by the brief aoes), then dodge into it once the first aoe goes off
abyssal quasar - enumerations on either all supports or all dps
	have melee pair with melee and ranged pair with ranged in each light party
	melee should dash to the boss once it's safe, to maintain uptime

eventide fall/triad - one of two abilities
	eventide fall - a line stack on each healer, stay in light parties
	eventide triad - a cleave towards a random tank, healer and dps
		role stack with tanks north, dps south and healers at the side

raidwide
tankbusters
phases of the shadow + burning/immolating shade - opposite of the previous

terrastorm + arctic assault + void blizzard iii - void blizzard iii is a stack marker on each healer
	arctic assault will make one of the safe quadrants unsafe, so everyone goes to the sole safe quadrant
	assign close/far priority for each light party

raidwide

gale sphere + void tornado/void aero iii - the first dodge is paired with one of two mechanics
	void tornado - a stack marker on each healer
		use the same north/south or east/west priority for light parties
	void aero iii - enumerations on either all support or all dps
		have melees be closer to the boss and ranged be closer to the edge
arctic assault
void aero iii/void tornado - opposite of the first mechanic
	this is paired with the final dodge, so try to preposition on the 3rd dodge
	this also means each mechanic can be done either horizontally or vertically

phases of the blade
raidwide
azdaja's shadow
void stardust 2 + abyssal quasar - this time the exaflares start closer to the middle and end up at the edge
lingering spark
eventide triad/fall - opposite of the previous

double meteor
tankbusters
gale sphere + void tornado/void aero iii
arctic assault
void aero iii/void tornado - opposite of previous
phases of the blade
raidwide
azdaja's shadow
phases of the shadow + immolating/burning shade
