murky depths - raidwide

doubled impact - a double-stack tankbuster

spoken cataract x2 - the head and body will each face different directions, then do a half-room cleave and line aoe respectively
	the head will do the half-room cleave in the direction it's facing
	this can always be dodged on a platform, but don't be too close to the body
	grates on safe platforms will always be safe

raidwide

sewage deluge - a big raidwide that will make only the four corner platforms and the drains between them safe

tainted flood - a spread aoe on every player

predatory sight - gives every player an abandonment marker, make sure to stack with at least one other player

shockwave - the boss turns towards a platform, then leaps there and does a knockback
	make sure you get knocked through the drains and not into the sewage

dissociation - the head flies away and cleaves from north to south either on the east side or west side

coherence - does a flare marker on the MT, followed by a line stack on a random player
