crown of arcadia - raidwide

draw steel - draws one of three weapons, the first one is always an axe or scythe
smashdown - executes the corresponding aoe based on the weapon drawn
	axe - point-blank aoe
	scythe - doughnut aoe
	sword - plus-shaped aoe oriented towards the direction he's facing
draw steel + smashdown - opposite of the previous (never sword)

void stardust - a series of three spread aoes on each player
	each aoe leaves a lingering puddle that explodes after a few seconds, so move afterwards

draw steel + smashdown - always sword

trophy weapons - summons one of each weapon type
assault evolved - tethers to each weapon in turn, charging towards them and executing their aoes centred on that position

trophy weapons + assault evolved

dance of domination trophy - draws a sword
dance of domination - a multi-hit raidwide that leaves a series of lines on the arena that explode after a few seconds

raw steel trophy - draws an axe
raw steel - a double-stack tankbuster and a spread aoe on every other player

charybdistopia - reduces everyone's hp to 1

ultimate trophy weapons - begins summoning six weapons one by one
assault apex - dashes to each weapon in turn, executing their corresponding aoe
	two of them leave tornadoes on the ground that do dodgeable cone aoes at the end
	since the aoes overlap, dodge from a safe spot into a previous intersection of aoes

immortal reign + one and only - grants a power buff, then does a follow-up raidwide

meteorain - spawns four towers that need to be soaked, each one spawning a meteor
foregone fatality + massive meteor - two portals do tankbuster tethers towards the meteors, while a stack marker goes out on a random player
	the tethers need to be taken by tanks to save the meteors
	this then all happens a second time
double tyrannhilation - a massive aoe that can only be avoided by hiding behind a meteor
	make sure to hide behind a corner meteor as the aoe hits twice and will crumble any meteor that blocks the first hit

flatliner - a knockback from the boss that destroys the middle column of the arena
	make sure there's at least two players on each side
majestic meteor - three sets of baited puddles followed by a criss-cross of line aoes from portals
fire and fury - two cone aoes from the boss that make the middle parts of the platforms unsafe
	two proximity aoes spawn on opposite corners that you need to dodge by standing in a safe corner
	two knockback towers spawn on each platform that need to be soaked
	either get knocked to the other side, or across your current platform, never diagonally
majestic meteor - exactly the same mechanic loop but without the fire and fury cone aoes, and there are only two towers this time
arcadion avalanche - looks towards one platform, then grabs it and throws it towards the other platform
	use the tower to get to (or stay on) the safe platform

raidwide - also restores the platform

heartbreak kick x2 - a multi-stack tower

majestic meteor - no knockback towers this time
fire and fury - goes off after the proximity aoes
void stardust - dodge the second round of majestic meteor after this
raidwide

great wall of fire - a double-stack line buster that leaves a lingering line aoe
	make sure to dodge out of it afterwards

loops from heartbreak kick x2 until defeated
