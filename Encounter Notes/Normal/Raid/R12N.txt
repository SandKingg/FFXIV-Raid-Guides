the fixer - raidwide

bloodshed - turns one arm into a dragon head
serpentine scourge - a half-room cleave on the side of the dragon-headed arm
ravenous reach - the dragon-headed arm snakes over either to the same side or the opposite side and does a big cone aoe through the arena
burst - afterwards, the head explodes into multiple gore puddles that expand quickly, doing point-blank aoes

cruel coil - drags every player into the centre of the arena and binds them, then encircles the middle of the arena in its coiling tail
	it will rotate three times, each time leaving a gap for everyone to escape through
	the second two also leave a vuln, and anyone who hasn't left after the third rotation will be insta-killed

visceral burst - aoe tankbusters on both tanks

bloodshed + serpentine scourge
grotesquerie - gives everyone a debuff that will do a point-blank aoe around them once it expires
ravenous reach + burst - this one will always do the opposite of the first one
	the spreads go off after the expanding aoes

splattershed - a raidwide that transforms both its arms into dragon heads
feral fission - snakes each arm through the arena, coiling over a rough-checkerboard pattern
bring down the house - destroys the parts of the arena below the coils, recreating some platforms to allow passage through the entire platform
??? - the two dragon heads shoot aoes through two columns of the platform
venomous scourge - a spread aoe on every player

grotesquerie 2 - gives everyone a delayed knockback debuff and a delayed cone aoe debuff
	one healer will get a delayed stack debuff
	the knockbacks go off first, don't get knocked off the platform
ravenous reach - the stack goes off at the same time here, make sure to stack in the safe spot
	then point your cone aoes away from other players
	the platform also returns to normal here

bloodshed + serpentine scourge - this time both arms turn into dragon heads
	the line aoe is always from the second head to form
splattershed - returns his arms to normal
tankbusters

cruel coil - this time you only have two chances to leave before you get insta-killed

grotesquerie 3 - gives everyone a delayed knockback debuff and a delayed spread debuff
burst - two expanding aoes appear, use the knockback to avoid them
	do the spreads after this

bloodshed + serpentine scourge
bloodshed + serpentine scourge + burst - dodge the line aoe and the expanding aoes
raidwide

mindless flesh - a series of line aoes, with a spread aoe on every player, then finally a massive cleave towards one side of the room
