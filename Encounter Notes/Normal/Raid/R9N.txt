killer voice - raidwide

half moon - a half-room cleave on the side she's aiming the kick towards, followed by another cleave on the opposite side

vamp stomp - summons bats and does a point-blank aoe that sends out a slow-moving shockwave
	whenever this shockwave hits a bat, it does another point-blank aoe centred on the bat

hardcore - an aoe buster on each tank

sadistic screech - a raidwide that transforms the platform
	the west and east columns get destroyed and the coffinmaker is summoned, starting the add phase
	
	coffinfiller - two column aoes, followed by two more aoes in the previous safe spots
	dead wake + flaying fry - a spread aoe on every player as the coffinmaker advances

	coffinfiller
	dead wake + penetrating pitch - a stack marker on each healer, as the coffinmaker advances again

	coffinfiller + half moon - make sure you're on the correct side to dodge the cleaves
	coffinfiller + half moon
	enrage
sadistic screech - raidwide that returns the platform to normal

crowd kill - a big raidwide that empowers some of her abilities

finale fatale - raidwide that turns the arena into a circle
	sets of 6 puddles drop down throughout the mini-phase that need to be avoided
aetherletting - four random players get aoe markers that drop either a plus or cross marker
	this indicates where a plus or x-shaped aoe will explode after a few seconds
aetherletting - the other four players get it this time
brutal rain - a multi-hit stack marker
insatiable thirst - a raidwide that returns the platform to normal

sadistic screech 2 - once again destroys the west and east columns
	saws will move across and around the arena throughout the mini-phase that need to be avoided
plummet - two towers spawn that need to be soaked
	then destroy the fatal flails before they finish their enrage cast
