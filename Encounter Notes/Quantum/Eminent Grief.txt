abyssal blaze - stretches open a portal either horizontally or vertically, indicating which direction the aoes will travel later
	these are stored in crystals on the floor in a diagonal pattern
	the second portal will always be opposite of the first, and the diagonal will be offset by 1 vertically and horizontally
	this will make one corner safe later

bounds of sin - drags everyone into the centre and creates a circle of aoes pointing either in or out will, indicating either a point-blank or doughnut
	look whether they finish north/south or east/west as that's where you should go
abyssal dawn - spawns a bleed tower in each corner
sin and punishment - supports and dps get sin and punishment markers that need to be cancelled out
	assign towers so that the two supports and two dps are diagonal from each other, meaning there is a viable pair for both aoe directions
	after the aoes cancel out, take your towers
	then go to the correct corner to dodge the abyssal blaze aoes

blade of first light + chains of condemnation/ball of fire - the eater draws one or two swords, indicating an aoe through middle or on both sides respectively
	this is paired with one of two casts, make sure you look to see which is going off first
	chains of condemnation - a pyretic debuff, stay still and stop attacking
	ball of fire - large, baited puddles on each player, keep moving in one direction and not towards anybody else

burning chains - chains supports to dps, supports run west and dps run east to break them

spinelash - marks one player to be bound and then does a wild charge line stack on them that breaks any windows at the back that it hits
	make sure to only break one window with this to limit the amount of adds summoned
	kill the add quickly as it does minibusters and random puddles

shackles of sanctity - marks the healer with a debuff that causes all healing they do to emit a large aoe pulse that also gives damage down
	make sure the healer stays away from the party towards a south corner

hellish earth - tethers the furthest away player and drags them towards the middle, while also doing a smaller draw-in on everybody else
	the tank should be tethered and everyone else needs to either use kb resist or stand far enough to not get drawn into the middle
	if the tank exits the middle area, they explode and wipe the raid
	five arcane fonts appear that should be focused down by the dps
eruption - three sets of puddles under everyone except the tank
manifold lashings - a triple-hit tankbuster tower followed up by a thick line aoe that shoots diagonally through the middle area and into the rest of the platform
	react quickly to which way the tail is coming from to dodge it
	each hit of the buster also gives a stack of poison
unholy darkness - raidwide + bleed
manifold lashings

abyssal blaze + eruption - dodge the puddles again
bounds of sin 2 - this time there will only be one direction to escape, but pay attention to whether it's out or in
sin and punishment - this happens after the abyssal blaze puddles this time
	assign specific pairs for this since there are no positioning requirements

crime and punishment - afflicts a random player with a stacking debuff that explodes and passes itself to anyone hit after reaching 16 stacks
	if you have light, then it stacks up much faster, whereas if you have dark then it stacks up much slower
	anybody hit by the pass explosion gets an esunable doom
	if nobody is hit by the explosion, the player who had the debuff begins pulsing massive raidwide damage, which is basically a wipe
	assign an order of players to pass through each time

blade of first light + chains of condemnation/ball of fire - after both mechanics have resolved, whoever had the first debuff switches to light and passes to the next player
spinelash - don't hit the window you already broke or a massive add will spawn which is basically a wipe
	after this, do the second debuff pass

bounds of sin 3 - same as the first one, but the aoes will always be pointing in
	look if the exits are east/west or north/south
burning chains - this time you'll need a north/south priority as well, in case you need to run in that direction

abyssal blaze
sin and punishment - do the third debuff pass in pairs here
	you will need to swap pairs in some cases here, based on who has the last debuff
drain aether x2 - look at which of the two casts will happen first
	the eminent grief requires you to be light, and the devoured eater requires you to be dark
	if you have the debuff you need to be dark for BOTH
	the eminent grief will drain the debuff away from you
	do the abyssal blaze puddles after this

unholy darkness

visceral flame - spawns a flameborn add at each corner that tethers to the first player to hit it and slowly walks towards them
	each add has an aoe around it that gives vulns if you stand in it
	making the add walk through dark will cause the aoe to rapidly expand
	making the add walk through light will cause the aoe to rapidly contract (if bigger than the default) or explode
	the explosion gives a 5-second fire vuln
	assign an order for players to walk their add through light to explode them
		the final player should wait for their add to time out, to make sure the vuln does not cause the next fire ability to one-shot
	two adds will merge to form a bigger add if they walk into each other

abyssal blaze - these puddles don't go off for a while
chains of condemnation/ball of fire + blade of first light - this will always be the fire ability first
	make sure to heal after the debuff if it's chains
abyssal dawn - these towers don't go off until a few seconds after the blade is cast
	you can stay outside until it's time to take them
bounds of sin 4 - just a single exit point again this time
spinelash - break the final window here, then run to the safe corner for the puddles
	kill the add in that safe corner
burning chains - run back to mid once it's safe from the puddles to avoid a weird positioning
